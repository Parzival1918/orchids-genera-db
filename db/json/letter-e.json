When they bloom, the bracteate heads or racemes of small brightly colored or white flowers identify the plants. Despite their small flowers, these plants are colorful. The genus was first described in 1827 by K.B. Presl. He coined the genus name from two Greek words, elle and anthos (flower), the former in honor of the mythological Helle of Helena, heroine of Hellespont. Hence, Elleanthus could be called Helle\u2019s or Helena\u2019s flower.\n\r\nThese sympodial terrestrial or epiphytic plants form clumps of cane-like stems that are supported by a mass of fleshy roots. These erect, reed-like stems may or may not be branched and, depending on the species, may be covered with numerous small purple dots that make the stem appear purple. The sessile, clasping leaves vary from lineate to lanceolate and are usually arranged in two ranks. Individual leaves may be up to 8 inches (10 cm) long and strongly veined to pleated. The leaves are often smaller near the top of the stem. The terminal inflorescence may be capitate (a head) or a raceme. The flower color ranges from white to yellow to orange to red to almost purple.\n\r\nThe small flowers may be tightly clustered or loosely arranged on the inflorescence and often do not open fully. Each flower is subtended by a bract that may be green or almost as colorful as the flower. In Elleanthus capitatus the flowers are embedded in transparent mucilage. Most commonly cultivated species include: E. capitatus, E. furfuraceus, E. hymenophorus, E. longibracteatus.",

Since that time, the number of species in this genus, Epidendrum and a number of other genera segregated from Epidendrum at various times, has varied dramatically. In 1997, Higgins established the genus Prosthechea, moving many former Encyclia species in a further attempt to classify this group. Over time, there will likely be other changes as well.\n\r\nEncyclias are extremely variable and range in size from 2 inch plants up to pseudobulbs the size of softballs with leaves 2 feet or more in length. In spite of this variability, they all share the common feature of a lip that, while not fused to the column, more or less enfolds it. The name Encyclia is derived from the Greek word enkyklein, which refers to the lip encircling the column. Commonly grown species are Encyclia cordigera (often seen horticulturally as Encylia atropurpurea, a completely misapplied name); Encyclia cochleata \u00a0(now Prosthechea cochleata), Encyclia tampense and Encyclia alata.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0",

The name is derived from the Greek epistephes meaing wreathed or crowned, referring to the calyx at the apex of the ovary. The type species, collected in the Department of Tolima, Colombia, is Epistephium elatum, published in 1822 in Syn. Pl. Aequin. 1:340.\u00a0\n\r\nThe flowers and general plant habit of Epistephium resemble Sobralia. However they are not related and are an example of convergent evolution. Epistephium leaves are shiny or glossy, with an unusual reticulate (branching) vein structure, whereas Sobralia leaves are dull and plicate with parallel veins.\u00a0\n\r\nThis World Checklist of Monocotyledons recognizes 22 species of Epistephium. Other terrestrial genera belonging to this Tribe include Pogonia, Isotria, and Cleistes. Traits that Epistephium shares with the Vanilla group include winged seeds and the presence of true pollinia. Epistephium flowers have four compressed, granular pollinia. However, the growth habit differs between Vanilla (epiphytic, with scandent, flexible, long stems) and Epistephium (terrestrial, with erect growth).\n\n\r\nThe habitat ranges from open savannah grasslands & prairies to hot, humid lowlands and low montane rainforest. They are mostly large, cane-like plants, growing to 5-6 meters high. Epistephium has terminal inflorescenses which each bear several flowers successively. Flowers are large, brightly-colored, often lavender-magenta, but have thin substance and are short-lived.",

They bear two to three leaves, up to 45 cm tall, that are plicate and are heavily veined. Terrestrial species have smaller bulbs and leathery leaves that develop strong pigmentation. Inflorescences rise from the base of the pseudobulb, are up to 40 cm tall and are usually many-flowered. The flowers are about 2-3 cm in diameter and are variations of yellow, orange and purple. The name Eriopsis is a combination of two Greek words, opsis, which means \"appearance\" and Eria, which is a genus of orchids that Eriopsis resembles. The type species is the terrestrial Eriopsis biloba. Commonly grown species are Eriopsis biloba, Eriopsis sceptrum, \u00a0Eriopsis helenae.",

Vegetatively, the plants consist of rosettes of thin, small (around 1 inch [2.5 cm]), shiny leaves, and are somewhat allied to Lankesterella. An inflorescence of one or more small but intricate flowers, mostly greenish in color, arises from the center of the rosette to be more or less visible. Eurystyles ananassocomos is found in dense forests of Jamaica and nearby Caribbean islands. The specific epithet alludes to the resemblance of the inflorescence to a pineapple.",
