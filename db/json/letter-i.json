I. utriculariodes is probably the most well-known of the approximately 10 species. The genus was described in 1815 and is allied to Comparettia. It was named after two Greek words, ion (violet) and opsis (appearance) in reference to the flowers which somewhat resemble violets (Viola). Although appearing pseudobulbless, Ionopsis is characterized by very short, small pseudobulbs which are hidden by the base of the clasping leaves. The small,dainty flowers are white or white with violet or a pale lavender-pink with violet stripes and are produced in large numbers so that a well grown plant is a feast for the eye.",

Two of these species, Isabelia virginalis (described by Barbosa Rodrigues as the type of the genus) and I. pulchella (first described by Kraenzlin in 1897 as Neolauchea pulchella), are completely different vegetatively and the flowers are not that similar either. Isabelia virginalis produces plants with very short rhizomes and pseudobulbs covered with \u201chairs\u201d produced by the decomposing sheaths; the final result resempling a small catterpillar. Isabelia pulchella produces pyramidal pseudobulbs on a very long rhizome, resembling some species of Bulbophyllum. Isabelia virginalis produces small flowers on short inflorescences while I. pulchella produce its small, colorful magenta flowers on fairly long (to 3\u201d) ones. Both species require similar growing conditions. They are found at altitudes from 2,000 to 4,000 feet (650 to 1,200 m) and more to the dryer interior of southern Brazil. In these areas, those high elevations are subject to dry and cold winters so plants can withstand temperatures down to the low 40s without problems as long as they are kept dry.\u00a0\n\r\nThe third species, Isabelia violacea has long been in cultivation under the name Sophronitella violacea. Recent genetic data suggests that Sophronitella should be considered a synonym of Isabelia",

        "description": "eye-soh-KYE-lus (click on the name to hear it spoken)\r\nTribe: Epidendreae\u00a0\r\nSubtribe: Laeliinae\n\n\nIsochilus is a genus of low to moderate elevation species from Mexico, the tropical Americas and the Caribbean. The species are not clearly defined and plants in commerce may be mislabeled. However, all species are attractive subjects well worth growing. The genus was described by Robert Brown in 1813. The name, iso (equal) and cheilos (lip) alludes to the more-or-less equal size and shape of the lip and the other floral segments. The most distinguishing feature of the genus are the slender stems with narrow distichous leaves giving these orchids an attractive fern-like appearance - the plants are indeed attractive even when out of bloom. The species produce mostly small pink to fuchsia flowers on a terminal inflorescence of second year growths. There are some species or varieties in which the color ranges toward reddish orange. Commonly encountered species are Isochilus linearis and Isochilus major.",
