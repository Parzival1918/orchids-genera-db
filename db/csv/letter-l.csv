Laelia,Lindl. 1831,"lay-LEE-uh (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Epidendreae 
Subtribe: Laeliinae


Laelia was formerly a large genus that included species in Mexico and Brazil. With the publication of Genera Orchidacearum Vol. 5 in 2009 the Brazilian laelias were moved into an expanded concept of Cattleya based upon DNA evidence.

Laelia species currently number 24 and include some formely included in Schomburgkia.

 It is not certain what ""Laelia"" means, but it seems that Lindley gave the genus the name of one of the Vestal Virgins from Greek Mythology, referring to their beauty. Three of the former sections occur in Mexico (and share many structural features) while the majority of species, occur in Brazil. Many of the Mexican species (Laelia anceps, for example), grow in dry areas where the plants are subject to very low temperatures and even frost, and so they should be grown cooler for their best development. The Brazilian species can be found from sea level up into the mountains, so their growing conditions vary from very warm to cool depending on the particular species. The type species is Laelia speciosa, a Mexican species with compact plants and very showy large flowers. Laelia purpurata, now Cattleya purpurata, the Brazilian national flower.

The former section Parviflorae, the so-called ""Rupiculous laelias"" from Brazil, includes more than half the species (35+). This section is in the genus Cattleya as recognized by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families but some taxonomists classify them as Hoffmannseggella.","23 in the strictest definition of the genus and around 70 in the broadest sense. Color forms number the hundreds. It should be noted that there is currently great debate regarding which species should actually be included in this genus. The World Monocot Checklist currently recognizes only 23 species; the ""rupiculous laelias"" and those of section Cattleyodes having been moved to Sophronitis (see above). In addition, many former Schomburgkia species have been moved to Myrmecophila and the remaining species transfered to Laelia.","Tropical America, Brazil"
Laelia Sec.Cattleyodes,,"cat-le-YO-dees (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Epidendreae 
Subtribe: Laeliinae

Section Cattleyodes includes the largest flowered Brazilian species of the genus. Actually, the largest ones, period, as Laelia purpurata is reported to have flowers as large as 25 cm. (10"") wide, but this is certainly atypical. Flower size varies usually from 1 ½"" on Laelia virens to 8"" in L. tenebrosa and L. purpurata, with the other species in-between. Laelia purpurata is probably the species with the widest color variation in the section, and basic color on segments varies from white to light pink-magenta. The variation includes stripes, veins and splashes on petals, but is most impressive on the lip, where veins can come in different tones of pink, purple, violet, blue-gray, brick red, etc. Several of the other species have flowers in magenta tones, but Laelia tenebrosa, L. grandis and L. xanthina are found in yellow to brown and L. virens is green. 

In terms of distribution, the species are essentially coastal and only a few extend slightly (max 100 miles) into the interior, thus most of them are fairly low elevation plants. The exception is Laelia virens, which is usually found between 2,500 - 4,000 ft (more or less 800 to 1300 m.) and thus can be considered the coolest growing species in the group. While the majority are low elevation species, their distribution is more to the south of Brazil, making them very-well adapted to a wide range of temperatures. As an example, Laelia purpurata can withstand temperatures from 100 degrees F down to freezing if kept relatively dry.","9, color forms in the hundreds. Currently the World Monocot Checklist considers these species to belong to a greatly expanded genus Sophronitis however Genera Orchidacearum Vol. 5 will transfer the entire expanded Sophronitis to Cattleya and the World Checklist will follow soon thereafter.","Tropical America, Brazil."
Laelia Sec.Hadrolaelia,,"ha-dro-LAY-lee-a (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Epidendreae 
Subtribe: Laeliinae

Section Hadrolaelia includes species that produce fairly large flowers on small plants. The section includes well-known species such as Laelia pumila, L. praestans and L. dayana, that all produce flowers that are 3"" to 5"" across on plants that are barely larger than that. As a result, due to its deep magenta color, Laelia pumila has been used extensively in hybridizing to produce miniature cattleyas. 

These three species usually grow in forested areas under shady and humid conditions, at elevations usually above 2,500 ft. (about 800m.) so they are intermediate growers. Laelia sincorana and L. jongheana grow in more interior habitats and at higher elevations, usually above 4,000 ft. (around 1,300 m.); these two species grow exposed to a lot more sunlight and wind. Laelia sincorana produces flowers that are quite similar to those of L. pumila, and L. jongheana produces the largest flowers in the section, up to 6"" across. 

The sixth species is Laelia alaorii, the most recently described. It comes from coastal humid forest in the state of Bahia, at elevations around 1,000 ft. (some 300 m.); this is the warmest growing species in the section, and also the one that produces the smallest plants and flowers. It is also the species with lighter colored flowers and less color variation. An interesting, and characteristic feature of the species in this section is that they produce their flowers directly with the new growth, that is, without a protective flower sheath.","6, several more color forms. The World Monocot checklist currently considers these species to belong to a greatly expanded genus Sophronitis although Genera Orchidacearum Vol. 5 will transfer the entire genus Sophronitis to Cattleya and the World Checklist will follow soon thereafter.","Tropical America, Brazil."
Laelia Sec.Microlaelia,Schltr.,"mi-cro-LEh-lee-a (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Epidendreae 
Subtribe: Laeliinae

Section Microlaelia includes only one species, Laelia lundii. This species has a wide distribution range in the dryer interior of Brazil, from the state of Paraná in the south to the Federal District (where the Brazilian capital, Brasilia, is located) in the north. The habitat is semi-deciduous gallery forests (epiphytic) in the southernmost and northernmost parts of the range, and on large rock outcropings (lithophytic) in the state of Minas Gerais (where the plants are exposed to a lot of light and a fair amount of wind). Under these conditions, Laelia lundii grows on rocks or on short twisted trunks of semi-deciduous trees and produces large plants that can sometimes be several feet across. The plants produce small elliptic pseudobulbs topped by two narrow but fleshy leaves separated by long rhizome sections. The small (around 1"") flowers appear 2-4 from the top of the pseudobulbs and have fairly narrow and similar white, pink tinged sepals and petals. The lips are white with bright magenta stripes.","1, few color forms. The World Monocot Checklist currently considers this species to belong to a greatly expanded genus Sophronitis however Genera Orchidacearum Vol. 5 will transfer the entire Sophronitis to Cattleya and the World Checklist will follow soon thereafter.","Tropical America, Brazil"
Laelia Sec.Parviflorae,Lindl.,"Par-vee-FLO-rae (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Epidendreae 
Subtribe: Laeliinae

Section Parviflorae includes the plants known as ""rupiculous laelias"" due to the fact that they mostly grow on rock ledges. There are, however, 3 species that actually grow on trees and the plants are different mainly due to the fact that they grow under much shadier conditions, producing slender plants. Rupiculous laelias usually grow exposed to a good amount of light, especially the smaller plants. Species that produce larger plants usually grow protected by shrubs or grasses and many times can be seen only when they produce their inflorescences above the surrounding vegetation. 

Rupiculos laelias always produce brightly colored flowers, and in this regard we have basically three groups, the first one producing yellow flowers (L. briegeri, L. esalqueana, L. bradei); the second one producing orange to red flowers (L. milleri, L. angereri, L. sanguiloba) and the third producing pink to magenta or purple flowers (L. lucasiana, L. rupestris, L. caulescens). Among these groups, the yellow flowered ones have small to large plants and short to long inflorescences according to the species, as do the pink to purple flowered species; the orange to red species are usually tall (with the exception of Laelia milleri). Habitats are usually more or less windy, so these plants require plenty of air circulation. In their natural habitats, plants grow with their rhizomes and roots protected from direct sunlight so, although the plants get plenty of sun their lower parts always have some shade and humidity available.",Around 40. The World Monocot checklist currently considers these species to belong to a greatly expanded genus Sophronitis. Other taxonomists have proposed transfer of these species to the genus Hoffmannseggella. Genera Orchidacearum Vol 5 will transfer the entire genus Sophronitis to Cattleya and the World Checklist will follow soon thereafter.,"Tropical America, Brazil."
Laeliopsis,Lindl. 1853,"Lay-lee-op-sis (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Epidendreae 
Subtribe: Laeliinae


Despite years of confusion among Laeliopsis and its allied genera Broughtonia and Cattleyopsis, it seems that only one species, L. domingensis, belongs in this genus however, the World Monocot Checklist currently considers Laeliopsis to be syonymous with Broughtonia. Although by taxonomic standards, the genus more resembles Cattleya due to its four pollinia rather that eight as is characteristic of Laelia, the derivation of its name comes from the resemblance of the flowers to those of Laelia. Its single species has been used numerous times in intergeneric hybridization.","The World Monocot Checklist no longer recognizes this genus, having transferred its one species L. domingensis to Broughtonia.",Hispaniola and Mona Island in the Caribbean
Lankesterella,Ames 1923,"lang-kess-ter-ELL-uh (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Cranichideae 
Subtribe: Spiranthinae


Lankesterella at first glance looks like it was developed by a committee. The sharp contrast between the smooth, almost porcelainlike, texture of the leaves and the hairy inflorescence, coupled with the emerald-green veins on the lip (e.g., L. gnomus) makes one wonder whether the various parts belong to the same plant. These interesting miniature sympodial epiphytes were originally placed in a variety of genera, including Spiranthes, but in 1923, Oakes Ames, citing several taxonomic differences, placed them in a separate genus. He named it Lankesterella to honor Charles H. Lankester, an avid plant collector in Costa Rica.

Vegetatively, the plants are much alike, but do vary slightly in leaf shape and arrangement. Some have rosettes of leaves while others are more irregularly arranged. The fleshy leaves, up to 2-1/2 inches (7 cm) long may have entire margins or be ciliate on the upper half of the margins. New rosettes of leaves form each year and over time clumps of rosettes are formed. The hairy terminal inflorescence arises from the center of the leaves and may be either erect or pendent and bears a few small flowers (1/2 inch [1.25 cm]). The base flower color is white or light green; some flowers have distinct emerald-green veins. Each flower is subtended by a hairy floral bract. 

The unique flowers of Lankesterella vary little among species, although some are more tubular than others. The three sepals are narrower than the petals, and are often greenish and hairy on the outside. The petals are broader, usually white and smooth on both sides. Due to the fusion of some of the floral segments, dissecting these flowers is difficult. Species in cultivation include L. gnomus and L. oligantha (synonym L. ceracifolia).",The World Monocot Checklist currently recognizes 12 species. (7/2009),Costa Rica to Brazil and Bolivia
Lepanthes,Swartz 1799,"le-PAN-theez (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Epidendreae 
Subtribe: Pleurothallidinae


Found in moist tropical forests over a large area stretching from Mexico to Brazil, the type species Lepanthes concinna was first described in 1799. Many of the species of this genus are obscure and little known, poorly defined or not yet described. It is a genus in flux. Lepanthes is allied to Pleurothallis and derives its generic name from the Greek lepis (scale) and anthos (flower) referring to the very small flowers of many of the species in this genus. Yet, if one took the time to study the diminutive flowers at close range, it would be found they are most unusual and daintily attractive. The complex tiny flowers are often brightly hued but short lived.

Lepanthopsis,(Cogn.) Ames 1933,"leh-pan-THOP-siss (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Epidendreae 
Subtribe: Pleurothallidinae


The generic name Lepanthopsis refers to its similarity to Lepanthes as the stems are also ringed by sheaths. Many members of this genus have many small flowers that will bloom simultaneously on the inflorescence while others will at least have several flowers open at the same time. Several species will bloom off and on throughout the year and others like to get a flush of flowers all at once. Plants grow epiphytically in moist tropical forests from 800 m (2,600 feet ) to 3,200 m (10, 500 feet).",The World Checklist of Monocotyledons now recognizes 42 species.

Leptotes,Lindley 1833,"lep TOE teez (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Epidendreae 
Subtribe: Laeliinae


Leptotes, from the Greek for delicateness. A group of small to miniature species all remaining under about 8” in height. They have short rhizomes and quickly form tight clumps. All species have very small (almost indistinguishable from the leaves) pseudobulbs with compact fleshy cylindrical leaves (appearing terete). Racemes arise from the apex of the pseudobulb at the base of the leaf and produce single to several flowers. The long-lasting flowers are proportionally large for the size of the plant. Leptotes bicolor is the type species and Leptotes tenuis (syn. minuta) is the smallest at under an inch. The seed capsules of Lpt. bicolor were at one time used to produce a vanilla-like flavoring for ice cream. Lpt. bicolor blooms from late winter to summer, and Lpt. unicolor blooms from fall to early spring in cultivation. Most species are fragrant. Commonly ultivated species include; Leptotes bicolor Lindley 1833, Leptotes unicolor Barbosa-Rodrigues, Leptotes tenuis Rchb. f 1865.",The World Monocot Checklist contains 8 accepted names (9/2007).,"Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay in mid elevation subtropical rainforests and coastal mountains."

Louis C. Richard established this cosmopolitan genus in 1818. The generic epithet is from the Greek liparos = greasy or shining and refers to the shiny leaves of many of the species. Type species for this genus is Liparis loeselii. There are two distinct growth habits in this genus, terrestrial and epiphytic. The terrestrial species usually have a single large leaf on a single stem whereas the epiphytes have pseudobulbs, which are unifoliate. Commonly grown species are Liparis condylobulbon, Liparis latifolia, Liparis nutans, and Liparis viridiflora.<",The World Checklist of Monocotyledons recognizes more than 500 species and their varietal forms.

Known more for its beautiful, deep red velvet-like leaves with attractive venation than for its small whitish to pinkish flowers, Ludisia is a monotypic genus, allied to the other “jewel orchids”, Anoectochilus and Macodes. Ludisia is found in many collections because of its beautiful leaves, although a specimen-sized plant with many several-flowered inflorescences can be a memorable sight. Ludisia is generally easy to grow given the right culture, and thrives on standard houseplant care, much like African violets. The only species to date in this genus is L. discolor.",Monotypic.

The genus Lycaste was formerly divided into four sections: Fimbriatae, Deciduosae, Lycaste and Longisepalae. The species of section Fimbriatae - Lycaste barringtoniae, Lycaste ciliata, Lycaste cinnabarina, Lycaste costata, Lycaste dyeriana Lycaste fragrans, Lycaste fulvescens Lycaste gigantea, Lycaste lanipes Lycaste linguella, Lycaste locusta and Lycaste reichenbachii - have spineless pseudobulbs, persistent leaves, typically green sepals and petals, and a fimbriate lip. Results of DNA analysis provide strong support for the separation of Lycaste section Fimbriatae from the rest of the genus. These species appear to be much more closely related to Anguloa than to the remaining three sections of Lycaste. Recently, these species have been transferred to a newly created genus, Ida.",The World Checklist of Monocotyledons recognizes 31 species and 3 natural hybrids.
