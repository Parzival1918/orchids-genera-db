Tribe: Collabieae
Subtribe: [not yet defined]

Acanthophippium is a terrestrial and sometimes saprophytic genus of sympodial orchids first described in 1825 by K. L. Blume. It has often been misspelled as Acanthophippium and the various species have been scientifically described with both spellings. The species have prominent, tapered bulbs that are up to 15 cm long and 5 cm wide and have large plicate leaves. The flowers are very unusual being bottle or cup-shaped somewhat like a tulip, waxy, and have a very strong fragrance. They have a wide range of colors mostly being shades of orange, red and yellow. The name Acanthophippium is a combination of two Greek words, akanthe, meaning spur or thorn, and ephippion, meaning saddle. These refer to the shape and structure of the blade of the lip. The type species is Aca. javanicum. Commonly grown species are Aca. mantinianum; Aca. javanicum; Aca. striatum.",Currently the Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families recognizes a total of 13 species (2/2012).,"Tropical old world, ranging from Southern China and S.

Acineta,Lindley 1843,"ah-si-NEE-ta (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Cymbidieae 
Subtribe: Stanhopeinae

An awe-inspiring sight is a well grown plant with numerous pendent inflorescences with 20 or more, usually large 2 inch (5 cm), flowers growing from a hanging basket. John Lindley described this genus, which vegetatively closely resembles Stanhopea in 1843. The genus name is derived from the Greek akinetos (immovable) in reference to the rigid, jointless aspect of the lip. In floral characteristics, Acineta more closely resembles Pescatorea or Peristeria, although the pendent habit of the inflorescence is that of Stanhopea.

The approximately 15 species of this genus are normally epiphytic but occasionally can be found growing as terrestrials on steep embankments at elevations from 2600-6600 ft (800 to 2,000 meters ). Species in cultivation include Acn. superba and Acn. chrysantha.",Currently the Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families recognizes a total of 17 species (8/2012).,"From S.

Ada,Lindl 1853,"Ay-da (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Cymbidieae
Subtribe: Oncidiinae

Etymology: Named for Ada, sister of Artemisia. First described by John Lindley in 1854. The genus is mostly epiphytes, but occasionally lithophytic, growing in wet cloud forests between 1500 and 2800m. Most species are presumed to be pollinated by hummingbirds.

The genus consisted of Ada aurantiaca and Ada lehmannii until the “glumaceous” (membrane-like) brassias were added by Norris Williams in 1972. Then in 2011, Chase and Whitten moved the glumaceous brassias out of the genus Ada again based on DNA sequence data. Currently, the Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families considers Ada to be a synonym of Brassia.",The WCSP now recognizes the 20 or so species to be in the genus Brassia.,"Andean areas of Columbia, Ecuador, and Peru.

Aerangis,Reichenbach f. 1865 ,"air-ANG-giss (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Vandeae 
Subtribe: Aerangidinae

My acquaintance with Aerangis began in the Kenya highlands early in the 1960’s. Although I cannot remember the exact date, I can remember the plant that made such a striking impression on me. I came face to face with it growing as a low-level epiphyte in a dense thicket of trees and shrubs near the river at about 8,000 feet above sea level, just north of the Equator. Several inflorescences were in full flower; their pristine white blooms with long curving nectaries, or spurs, presented a most elegant sight. Later I discovered that it was Aergs. thomsonii. Thus my interest in this attractive genus began and still continues today. 

The name Aerangis was coined from two Greek words, aer, air and angos, vessel, and was probably a reference to the nectariferous spur at the base of the lip. Plants allocated to this genus today are among the most attractive of the white-flowered vandaceous orchids of Africa and its adjacent islands, including Madagascar.  

Many species of Aerangis were first described under the name Angraecum. It was in 1865 that H.G. Reichenbach proposed the genus Aerangis, separating it from Angraecum on account of the long slender rostellum that stretches forward from below the column apex, across the stigmatic surface, and by the long slender stipe that is located on the upper surface of this rostellum and supports the two pollinia. 

A major contribution to the recognition of the genus was that of the German botanist Rudolf Schlechter. In 1914 he transferred some of the well-known Madagascar species from Angraecum to Aerangis and in 1918 made an important review of all the African angraecoid orchids that dealt with an additional 11 species of Aerangis. More species have been added to the genus since then. 

Species most commonly found in cultivation include Aergs. articulata, Aergs. biloba, Aergs. citrata, Aergs. ellisii, Aergs. fastuosa, Aergs. luteo-alba and its variety rhodosticta, and Aergs. modesta.","Currently the Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families recognizes 51 species, 2 natural hybrids, and 4 varieties (8/2012).","Africa and its adjacent islands, including Madagascar.

When first described by John Lindley in 1824, these delicate flowers must have seemed floating in air, hence the generic name which is derived from the Greek aer (air) and anthos (flower). The translucent yellow, green or white flowers are borne on wiry, up to 3 ft. (90 cm.) long stems and are allied to Angraecum. Of the 30 to 40 species known, most are found in Madagascar and the adjacent islands off the east coast of Africa. Flowers vary in size but can be up to 4 inches (10 cm) wide and 5 inches (12.5 cm) tall and are often slightly fragrant. The flowers are characterized by an insect or spiderlike appearance. Aeranthes has been used in intergeneric hybrids, several being made with Angraecum, and at least one instance of a hybrid with Vanda (Vths. Helmut Paul = V. tessellata x Aerth. grandiflora).

Aerides, literally ""child of the air"", is a genus of strong-growing monopodial epiphytes most resembling the genus Vanda. These orchids are popular for their freely produced pendent spikes of closely set, fragrant blooms. Often called ""foxtail orchids,"" this can lead to confusion with Rhyncostylis. Aerides are relatively fast growers and can bear a profusion of spikes from the main plant and its keikis. A few of the species are especially fascinating for their complex lip, which can obscure the column. Commonly seen species are Aerides fieldingii, Aerides lawrenceae, Aerides multiflorum, and Aerides odoratum. Aerides is beginning to be used more and more in hybridizing with related species and hybrids, especially vandas and ascocendas. ","Alex Hawkes cited ""more than 60"" and Phil Cribb of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, ""more than 20.""

The genus name derives from a Greek nymph, lover of the god Apollo. Specimens collected early on rarely lasted more than two years in cultivation. Seed grown plants have a much longer life expectancy. It was once thought to be monospecific i.e., a single species in this genus; however, four species are now known - Agn. cyanea, Agn. fimbriata, Agn. pulchella and Agn. rosariana.

Dr. Rudolf Schlechter proposed the generic epithet, Amesiella, in 1926 but he died before it could be published. Dr. Leslie Garay found Schlechter’s unpublished name and it was duly published in 1972. The epithet honors Professor Oakes Ames who named many Philippine orchid species in the first half of the 1900’s. Type species for this small genus is Ame. philippinensis. All the blooms are white in colour and Ame. monticola is perfumed, often at night. The flowers are large when compared with the size of the plant. Well-grown plants can produce several inflorescences. Commonly grown species are Ame. monticola and Ame. philippinensis. The third species in the genus is Ame. minor, known only from the type specimen, named in 1999. ","Currently, the Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families recognizes 3 species (8/2012). ",The genus Amesiella is endemic to the islands of Luzon and Mindoro in the Philippines.

Angraecum,Bory 1804,"an-GRAY-cum (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Vandeae
Subtribe: Angraecinae

Angraecum was established in 1804 by Colonel Bory de St. Vincent although some credit the French botanist Louis-Marie Aubert Du Petit-Thouars with the founding of this genus. Its name is a latinized form of the Malayan word angurek which is used to describe orchids with a growth habit similar to the genus Vanda. Angraecums, approximately two hundred species of white or greenish, generally star-shaped flowers, are typically monopodial in growth habit and are mostly epiphytic. Some Angraecum species are only a few inches high while others can reach over 6 feet. Perhaps most famous is Angcm. sesquipedale. Few orchidists are unaware of Charles Darwin’s prediction of a moth-pollinator with a very long tongue! 

Angraecum is a large genus, and one of the first described of the African orchids. As a result, many species, once placed in Angraecum have now been separated into other genera (eg. Aerangis and Jumellea). Few of the many species of Angraecum are found in cultivation. Most common are species such as Angcm. sesquipedale, Angcm. bicallosum, Angcm. leonis, Angcm. compactum, and Angcm. distichum. ","Currently, the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families recognizes a total of 223 species, 4 subspecies, and 7 varieties (8/2012).","Tropical Africa, Madagascar and adjacent islands."

The plants in this genus are quite large. Pseudobulbs can be over 9 inches tall and the plicate leaves on a well-grown plant can be over 4 feet long. This easily grown genus is terrestrial and the plant losses its leaves at the start of each season’s new growth. There are two basic groups of anguloas, white and yellow/red. White anguloas can produce up to six inflorescences per pseudobulb and the yellow/red up to twelve in late spring and early summer. There is usually one cupped flower per inflorescence. The flowers of all species are strongly fragrant. ","With reference to Dr. Henry F. Oakeley’s recent work, the genus is composed of nine distinct species and four natural hybrids. The species are: brevilabris, cliftonii, clowesii, dubia, eburnea, hohenlohii, tognettiae, uniflora, and virginalis. The four natural hybrids are: x acostae, x rolfei, x ruckeri, and x speciosa.

Anoectochilus was first described in 1828 by C.L. Blume with Anct. setaceus as the type species. Referring to the open appearance of the lip, that is due to a sharp bend on the narrow strip that directs the tip of the lip downwards, the generic name was coined from the Greek anoektos (open) and cheilos (lip).

Anoectochilus are small terrestrial plants that have creeping horizontal stems. One of the commonly named ‘jewel orchids,’ Anoectochilus has beautifully marked leaves which are far more showy than the erect inflorescences of small flowers it produces.",The Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families currently recognizes 43 species (8/2012).,"From India and SE Asia to Australia, Polynesia and adjacent islands. "

Tribe: Cymbidieae
Subtribe: Cymbidiinae

Owing to the extraordinarily wide range of the one species in this monotypic genus, Ansellia africana, there is great variation in plant and flower size, as well as in the coloration and patterning of the blooms. The plants are similar in that they are formed of upright clusters of slender, cigar-shaped pseudobulbs crowned with five to seven leaves that may be held generally upright to slightly arching. The leaves are evenly broad along their length, tapering to a roundly pointed tip. Leaves are generally medium green, while the pseudobulbs range from greenish cream to a mustardy yellow color. Smaller forms range from 12” – 18” tall, while some of the larger, more southerly forms may attain 48” or more in height. The overall plant habit is compact and freely branching, easily forming sizeable clumps. In nature, upright aerial roots form an effective detritus trap, and this feature is not uncommon in cultivation.

Inflorescences are usually terminal, though occasionally smaller flower stems may emerge from lower leaf axils. The terminal inflorescences are upright to arching, and are often profusely branched. Flowers are well held, though some forms do tend to “nod,” forcing the viewer to look up into the display to fully appreciate the beauty. The most popularly used common name is Leopard Orchid, and it is easy to see why. While some forms are albinistic to albino, with pure yellow green blooms, and others so heavily blotched with dark chocolate brown to appear black, most forms are mustard yellow variously marked with dark brown spots and blotches. Just like its Leopard namesake, markings vary from plant to plant. Flowers are very variable in size, ranging from around an inch, to nearly three inches in some of the finer and larger growing forms cultivated in South Africa. Petals and sepal are essentially equal in size and carriage, with a smaller lip. Form is open and flat, with some of the best forms being relatively full. Most people comment on the strong musky fragrance, which some find pleasant and others objectionable.

Highly select forms – very dark, albino, or large and full formed – are now entering the trade and can be relatively easily had, whether as divisions or seed-raised.

This is an excellent subject for frost-free areas where it can be a valuable addition to the landscape, quickly forming a showy clump in the crook of a tree or in a large basket. Growers in cooler climates should look for the smaller growing forms, which are no larger than a standard Cattleya.","1 – widely distributed and quite variable.

Arachnis is an epiphytic genus of vining, monopodial orchids, commonly referred to as “scorpian orchids.” It is allied to the genera Esmeralda and Armodorum, which also have flowers with a fixed lip and four pollinia. They are usually found between 0 and 1000m in wet tropical forests. The flowers are medium to large, showy, and fragrant, usually in shades of yellow to gold with red-brown markings. Arachnis hookeriana (syn. Ren. hookerana) is an exception, with white flowers. This name for this genus comes from the Greek arachne (spider), referring to the form of the flowers. The type species is Arachnis flos-aeris (Linné) Rchb. f., originally published as Arachnis moschifera by C.L. Blume in 1825, in Bijdragen tot de Flora van Nederlandsch Indie. Commonly grown species include Arachnis flos-aeris, Arachnis hookeriana, and a popular hybrid is Arachnis Maggie Oei (hookeriana x flos-aeris).","Currently, the Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families recognizes a total of 11 species, 4 varieties, and 1 natural hybrid (Arach. x maingayi (flos-aeris x hookeriana) (8/2012).","Himalayas and Southeast Asia to the Philippines, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands."

Arpophyllum are epiphytic or terrestrial plants with a slender, short stem with one uppermost, fleshy, leather-like leaf which is long and sickle-like and often channeled. The erect, dense raceme is cylindrical with many smallish, reddish-lavender flowers. Its name is derived from the Greek harpe (sickle) and phyllon (leaf). The largest of the species, Arpo. giganteum Hartweg ex Lindley, grows up to 70 cms. (27-1/2”) high, with leaves the same length and the inflorescence approximately 15 cms. (6”) in height. The type species is Arpo. spicatum La Llave & Lex. Arpophyllum is allied to Isochilus and Elleanthus but easily distinguished by its 8 pollinia, the solitary leaf atop a stout stem and the inflorescence, which is enclosed by a single large bract.","Currently, the Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families recognizes 3 species of Arpophyllum, and 3 subspecies of Arpo. giganteum (8/2012).",Neotropical; found mostly in Mexico with some ranging as far south as Colombia.

Ascocentrum is a genus of epiphytic monopodial orchids. The plants are typically compact and resemble miniature vandas. With the publication of Genera Orchidacearum volume 6, all Ascocentrum species are now included in the genus Vanda. Affected hybrid names are explained on this website here. These species produce upright, densely-flowered inflorescences in shades of bright golden yellow to orange-red or fuchsia-pink. Bloom season is usually late spring.

The genus name is derived from the Greek words for ""bag"" and ""spur"", denoting the distinct spur at the base of the lip, and was originally described by Schlechter. The species, notably Asctm. curvifolium, have been used extensively in hybridizing with other vandaceous genera.

Commonly grown species: Asctm. curvifolium, Asctm. ampullaceum, Asctm. garayi (correct name for plants often sold as Asctm. miniatum, with which it can be confused, or as Asctm. miniatum var. garayi, a synonym for Asctm. garayi).","Previously there were 13 species of Ascocentrum, and 2 subspecies of Asctm. aurantiacum.

Ascoglossum is derived from the Greek, askos, bag and glossa, tongue, in allusion to the saccate (pouch-shaped) lip. The flowers of Ascoglossum may be small and average for orchids but their color is striking. The large number of vividly colored blossoms borne on branched inflorescences make this plant stand out, and the very deep magenta stems add to the overall attractiveness. According to most taxonomists, this Pacific Islands genus consists of a single species, while others feel there may be two species.

Ascoglossum is closely related to Ascocentrum, but differs in floral characteristics and in having a branched inflorescence. Vegetatively, Ascoglossum species resemble Ascocentrum species when small, but tend to become more leggy with age as the stems rarely branch. The flowers seem much smaller than they are because the lateral sepals and petals are alike in color but differ in size, with the sepals larger than the petals and with the apices of the petals more acute. The lip looks almost bootlike, but is actually three-lobed with the major portion of the lip being the large saccate spur.
