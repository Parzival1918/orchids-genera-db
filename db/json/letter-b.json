Mr. Bateman was the author of the monumental Orchidaceae of Mexico and Guatemala. Although found over a broad area in tropical South America, Batemannia (sometimes spelled Batemania) has not been a common component of most collections. This small genus has showy, attractive flowers, which makes it well worth cultivating. Perhaps one reason Batemannia has not been appreciated by growers is the mild fragrance of the flower, which is typical of the genus. This fragrance has been characterized by some as \u201cthe smell of a sweet stink bug,\u201d not a very flattering description. Vegetatively, these sympodial epiphytes are recognized by their closely clumped, angular pseudobulbs, topped by up to 3 leaves and subtended by a number of large leafy bracts. Each leaf may be up to 12 inches (30 cm) long and 2 inches (5 cm) wide, The arched or pendent inflorescence arises from the base of the pseudobulb and averages three to six flowers. The flowers may be up to 3 inches (7.5 cm) wide. The base color is light green, often with a variable flush of maroon, giving the flowers a reddish brown appearance. The lip is white or white with reddish purple marks. Most commonly encountered species are Batemannia colleyi and B. armillata.",

The genus has presented taxonomic puzzles with some species being recently transferred to Rudolfiella, Coelia, Lacaena, Stenocoryne and Teuscheria. Bifrenarias are not too common in cultivation but Bif. harrisoniae with its lovely, large, white to pink fragrant blooms is more often seen. This and other species can be a challenge to flower but once a grower develops the knack, blooming is as regular as clockwork. The plants have a characteristic single, leathery, dark green leaf per squat, conic to somewhat flattened pseudobulb. Flower color varies from ivory through green, yellow and pink. Other species that can be found in collections include Bif. atropurpurea (3-6 medium reddish purple blooms that open best when grown cool), Bif. aureofulva (6-10 small orange blooms), Bif. charlesworthii (4-6 small fringed cream blooms), Bif. inodora (4-6 medium greenish blooms), Bif. tetragona (2-3 large purple-spotted green blooms) and Bif. tyrianthina ( 1-4 large rose-purple blooms).\u00a0\n\nBif. harrisoniae is a Brazilian species found growing on east-facing rocky cliffs at 700-2600 ft. The plants grow exposed to sun and wind but their roots anchor them firmly by penetrating cracks in the rock face. There is near perfect drainage, constant air movement, and bright light. Temperatures range from a high 80 F to a low of 60 F and quite a bit cooler in the months before flowering. Rainfall is concentrated in the warmer months and after the blooming season which is in spring in the Northern Hemisphere. Humidity is high year round.\u00a0\n\r\nAt the website of Delfina de Araujo , we found a Portuguese/English account of a floristic survey of the Bananal River margins in Rio de Janeiro Province, Brazil by Maria da Penha Fagnani. Although this part of Bananal river runs through an area of environmental protection, they found partial destruction of the forest in some areas but that the big trees which followed the river margin had been preserved. The river margin ecosystem is dependent upon the constant high humidity. Just 100 ft back from the river, the climate is dry by day. Three Bifrenarias found in this region are described as being rupicolous and growing above the water. They are spring-blooming Bif. harrisoniae, winter-blooming Bif. tetragona, and Bif. aureo-fulva which is also known from south and southeastern Brazil. It is clear from this Brazilian account that some Bifrenarias not only can grow lithophytically but they also grow over water where there is a steady year round supply of humid air irrespective of rainfall. We should bear in mind that these tough orchids like it humid and breezy even when watering is being withheld.\u00a0",

The heads of rather large, green and white blooms emerge from mature stems in spring, and are sweetly fragrant in the early morning. The pollinia are very easy to dislodge, so care must be taken not to jar or brush against the inflorescence. This genus hails from the savannah forests and dune environments. In these areas, seasonal rainfall dictates the growing season, so most of these species should be strongly seasonal in their growth and most will drop their foliage during a resting period. Large \u201ctubers\u201d carry them over between seasons, and plants can make sizeable clumps if well grown. The last season\u2019s tubers die as the new season\u2019s tubers are produced.",

Bulbophyllum and closely allied genera (especially Cirrhopetalum) are considered to be the largest group of orchids. Taxonomists have described at least two dozen allied genera, which have been combined with, and separated from, Bulbophyllum, over the years. Some of the most commonly encountered allied genera are; Cirrhopetalum, Ione, Mastigion, Megaclinium, Rhytionanthos and Trias. The plants are typically small to medium (although some have leaves up to a meter long) creeping epiphytes, having a sympodial growth habit with prominent pseudobulbs, with one or two fleshy leaves. There is a wide range of fantastic flower shapes and sizes (2 mm to 400 mm). All have a hinged lip that aids in pollination. The pollinator (most often a small fly) lands on the lip, which tilts and causes the pollinator to fall back in to the sticky pollina. The flowers are usually short lived (5-7 days) and are occasionally fragrant (while the fragrance can be pleasant it is often quite foul). Some commonly encountered species are: Bulbophyllum dearei, echinolabium, falcatum, fasinator, flabellum-veneris (syn. lepidum), guttalatum, lasiochilum, lobbii, longissimum, makoyanum, medusae, and putidum. Until recently little hybridizing has been done in the genus however, two particularly attractive hybrids are Bulbophyllum Daisy Chain; an example of the smaller umbellate-flowered group, and Bulbophyllum Elizabeth Ann; an wonderful example of the large-flowered group.",
        "species": "This is an enormous genus rife with synonymy. The actual number of species varies depending on whether or not the proposed, closely allied genera are included. Currently, the World Checklist of Monocotyledons recognizes only Trias as a separate genus and includes more than 2000 species in Bulbophyllum.",
        "distribution": "Predominately tropical or subtropical, although the range can extend into temperate regions. A few dozen species are found in the New World (South and Central American and the Caribbean). Several hundred species are found in equatorial Africa and the island of Madagascar. Most species are found in Asia; ranging from the foothills of the Himalayas (2500 m) in Indochina, down through Southeast Asia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia (especially Java, Borneo, Sumatra, Sulawesii), New Guinea, Australia, and New Zealand. The island of New Guinea, which has at least 600 species, is believed to be the dissemination point for the genus. Since Bulbophyllum species are a very diverse and wide ranging group of orchids, only general culture can be given. The grower should try and obtain habitat information for his/her species of interest.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0"
