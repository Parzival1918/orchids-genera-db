The name Renanthera is a combination of the Latin \"renis\" meaning kidney, and the Greek \"anthera\" or anther, and refers to the distinct kidney shape of the pollinia, characteristic of this genus.\nRenanthera is a monopodial genus from Southeast Asia, where weather and temperatures are optimal for a growth habit which has no pseudobulbs for water storage. The plants of some species are long and vining, others may be only 6-8 inches tall at maturity, and with a very short length of stem between alternating leaves. Most species are epiphytic, but several may be lithophytic. Some of the more vining species begin their lives as terrestrial seedlings germinated among the mycorrhizal fungi in dead logs and humus. Several species of Renanthera are narrow endemics, found only in a small area with very specialized habitat; Ren. imschootiana is considered rare and endangered and is listed on CITES Appendix 1 for which no international trade is allowed except for nursery-flasked and/or raised plants.\nRenanthera flowers are usually red, red-orange, or yellow, some with red or purple spots or blotches. Texture may be matte or velvety. Some species provide a spectacular display of 100+ flowers on a large branching inflorescence.\nRen. storiei, the species with the largest red velvety flowers, and unfortunately the largest plant habit, has been the most popular hybrid parent. More recent hybrids emphasize smaller plant size, and utilize Ren. philippinensis, Ren. imschootiana, and Ren. bella (all fine red-flowered species) as parents.",

The species are small in size, with a tufted growth habit. Despite their size, many of the species are quite showy with many single flowered inflorescences on a well-grown plant. The genus was named to honor Jos\u00e9 E. Restrepo, one of the early explorers of the Antioquian Andes in Colombia. Pridgeon calls Restrepia \u201ca well-defined genus of about 25 ill-defined species found in Central America and the Andes\u201d. The type species is R. antennifera. Other species found in specialist collections include R. dodsonii, R. muscifera (Pridgeon believes that many of the plants so labeled are indistinguishable look-alikes) and R. teaguei.\r\n.\u00a0\r\nIf you are interested in learning more, join the Pleurothallid Alliance, an AOS affiliated specially group",

However, this monotypic genus is probably more easily separated from some of its close relatives (such as Restrepia) by the presence of four pollinia instead of two and the easily recognized fetid odor of the flower. The genus was first described by Garay and Dunsterville in 1966 as they felt there were sufficient differences to warrant the change. They named the genus Restrepiella to indicate the close resemblance to Restrepia. Today, only the type species remains in the genus: all others have been transferred to either Restrepiopsis, Dressleriella or Pleurothallis.\n\r\nVegetatively, Restrepiella plants form tight clumps of erect secondary stems (ramicauls) connected by a short horizontal rhizome. Each secondary stem on this sympodial epiphyte is up to 8 inches (20 cm) tall and may have up to three nodes, each with a pronounced papery bract up to 3 inches (8 cm) in length. Each stem is topped by a single, erect, petioled, oblong leaf up to 7 inches (18 cm) long and 1-1/2 inches (4 cm) wide.\n\r\nThe flowers are borne in the axils of the leaves. Usually one flower, but occasionally two will open at the same time. Basically the flowers are creamy yellow with great variation in the number and size of the reddish spots. The small flowers (1-1/2 inches [4 cm]) are almost fleshy and have been likened to a serpent\u2019s wide-open mouth. The sepals are the largest floral segments with the lateral sepals fused almost to their tips similar to the synsepal in Paphiopedilum.\n\r\nInterested in this group?

Is it Rhyncholaelia, Laelia or Brassavola? In 1918, Rudolph Schlechter recognized that two species of spectacular flowering plants were sufficiently different taxonomically from Cattleya, Laelia and Brassavola to be placed in a separate genus. He coined the generic name Rhyncholaelia from the Greek word rhynchos (snout) and the genus name Laelia, undoubtedly a reference to the seed capsule, which Schlechter considered a main point in his generic separation. Although still debated by taxonomists, Rhyncholaelia is considered by most as the proper generic name. From a horticulturist\u2019s standpoint, however, Brassavola probably will continue to be used as the generic name to be consistent with the thousands of hybrids already recorded, that is until those names are changed.\n\r\nVegetatively, these sympodial epiphytes are very easy to distinguish from their close relatives. They have club-shaped to spindle-shaped pseudobulbs that often are hidden by very glaucous, almost white sheaths. Each pseudobulb is topped by a single stiff, leathery, gray-green, glaucous leaf that is usually elliptic and up to 8 inches (20 cm) long. Each growth bears a single flower subtended by a very large, leafy sheath.\n\r\nThe basic flower colors are light green to creamy white, with an occasional flower displaying a pale lavender-pink tint. The throats of the flowers range from emerald green in color to having a large rose-colored spot. The flowers which can be up to 7 inches (17.5 cm) in diameter are very similar as far as their sepals and petals are concerned, usually being alike in size, shape and color, with the segments of Rhyncholaelia glauca a little more reflexed. The lips, however, are so distinctly different that these two species can be separated easily without question. Rhyncholaelia digbyana has an extremely large, slightly three-lobed lip, which has a very deeply fringed margin, whereas R. glauca has a broad, blunt, fringeless lip",

This epiphytic, monopodial genus is characterized by its very thick, leathery, closely arranged leaves with short stems and, vegetatively closely resembles Aerides except for the shorter stems and thicker leaves. Due to the erect or pendent inflorescences of closely packed flowers, Rhynchostylis is commonly known as the foxtail orchid (as is Aerides). The generic name was derived from the Greek rhyncho, beak and stylis, column, in reference to the beaked column exhibited in this genus.\n\r\nThe flowers of Rhynchostylis are very fragrant, small and typically white with light to deep magenta, red or lavender-blue spots. Their small size is more than compensated for by the large number of flowers produced on multiple inflorescences. As a result of line breeding, many plants of Rhynchostylis gigantea exhibit boldly patterned flowers or seemingly solid colored dark red-lavender flowers (Sagarit strain). White and even peach-apricot colored forms have recently been introduced. Improvements have also been made to another commonly grown species in this genus, namely R. coelestis. In today\u2019s marketplace the hobbyist can find examples of this species of a deep lavender-blue color.\u00a0",
