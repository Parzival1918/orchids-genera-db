The generic epithet means helmet shaped and refers to the shape of the anther cap. The type species is G. baueri. The genus is characterized by the elongate, cylindrical or spindle-shaped pseudobulbs and thin, narrow, heavily veined, distichous leaves at the nodes. The inflorescences are produced from the top of the pseudobulbs and are few to many-flowered. Most of the species have very showy flowers with tubular lips. In most species, plants occur as epiphytes at low elevations between sea level to 500 meters. A few occur at higher elevations as terrestrials. Most commonly known are G. baueri, G. batemanii, and G. devoniana.",

The generic name, a combination of the Greek words gaster (stomach, belly) and cheilos (lip), refers to the unusual lips.\u00a0\n\r\nVegetatively, Gastrochilus species resemble small Phalaenopsis species with longer, narrower leaves. The thick, leatherly, fairly stiff leaves are almost lance-shaped and up to 7 inches (17.5 cm) long. The very short stems usually bear six to ten closely spaced leaves. One or more inflorescences arise from the axil of the lower leaves. The short, densely flowered inflorescence has a few to 20 flowers and may be erect or pendent. The color of the flowers ranges from a clear yellow (Gastrochilus dasypogon) to blotched with large brownish-purple spots (G. bellinus). Other species in this genus include G. calceolaris, G, formosanus, G. acutifolius, G. japonicus and others",

The species in this genus are superficially rather similar to those of Phaius and at times have been classified as Phaius species. The plants differ from those of true Phaius in their overall smaller and less robust stature and very different floral structure. The name Gastrorchis was first used by Thouars in 1809 and is derived from the two Greek words gaster (stomach or belly) and orchis (orchid) in reference to the sack-like lip base.\u00a0\n\r\nAll 8 species are essentially terrestrial plants and respond well in any well-drained moisture retentive medium. The plants produce small clustered pseudobulbs typically about 1-2cm in diameter and up to about 3cm tall. The evergreen ribbed leaves, 1-4 or 5 depending on the species, are typically a bright, glossy moderate green and are produced from the top of the pseudobulb. Individual leaves consist of a 15-25cm petiolate base and a leaf blade ranging from 15-30cm long and 8-10cm wide. The inflorescences, produced from the developing new growth, are erect and carry from 4 to 12 flowers depending on the species. The comparitively large, 2-2 \u00bd inch (5-6cm), richly colored flowers are strikingly beautiful and are produced in succession over a period of 3-5 weeks making them rewarding specimens.\u00a0\n\r\nThese species are very closely related to Phaius and Calanthe and several intergeneric hybrids have been registered. These include: Gastrophaius Dan Rosenberg (sold in the trade as Phaius Dan Rosenberg) = Gastrorchis tuberculosa x Phaius tankervilleae, and Gastrocalanthe Berryana = Calanthe masuca x Gastrorchis humblotii.\u00a0\n\r\nThe 8 currently recognized species are: Gastrorchis francoisii, G. geffrayi, G. humblotii, G. lutea, G. peyrotii, G. pulchra, G. simulans, and G. tuberculosa.\u00a0",

        "description": "go-MEZ-ah (click on the name to hear it spoken)\r\nTribe: Epidendroideae\u00a0\r\nSubtribe: Oncidiinae\n\n\nGomesa is a Brazilian tropical genus that was described by Robert Brown and named after Dr. Bernardino Antonio Gomes, a Portuguese physician and botanist. There may be several more species than the dozen currently recognized, but these names so far have not been clarified. These plants grow in mountainous coastal tropical rain forest at altitudes from 1,500 to 4,000 ft. (450 to 1,300m.) in the states of Rio Grande do Sul to Esp\u00edrito Santo. A few species find their way a bit more into the interior but always in humid forests around rivers. In the natural habitat, plants are epiphytic or lithophytic, usually with a lot of organic material trapped on the sheaths of the pseudobulbs. Plants of Gomesa produce fairly well-developed pseudobulbs, and the whole plants are more of a light dull green color than typical Oncidium types. Inflorescences are arched and produce numerous small (to 1\u201d) flowers where the dorsal sepal and petals stand up and lateral sepals point down, producing very peculiarly shaped flowers. Flowers are uniformly greenish-yellow to green, regardless of the species so it is sometimes quite difficult to set them apart. The flowers are usually strongly fragrant. The most common species in cultivation are Gomesa recurva and G. crispa, although a few others sometimes find their way into cultivation",

In general, gongoras are easy to grow into large and showy plants.This genus was named for Sr. Don Antonio Caballero y Gongora, Viceroy of New Granada (Colombia and Ecuador) and later Bishop of Cordoba; Governor of Peru during the Dombey, Ruiz & Pavon expeditions. The type species is Gongora quinquenervis, described by H. Ruiz & J. Pavon in 1794 in their Prodromus Florae Peruvianae et Chilensis.

A third species, Grobya fascifera, is very similar to G. galeata. Both these species occur at about 2,500 to 4,500 ft (800 to 1,400 m) elevation on the Brazilian coastal mountain range knows as \u201cSerra do Mar\u201d, the coastal range that runs parallel to and near the coast from the states of Rio Grande do Sul to Esp\u00edrito Santo, and on the second parallel mountain range to the interior, called \u201cSerra da Mantiqueira\u201d. The two species are very similar in growth habit, and both inhabit the tropical rain forest where humidity is high and fairly constant and conditions are shady. They also have in common pendent inflorescences and flowers that have a \u201chood\u201d formed from the dorsal sepal and petals. Grobya amherstiae carries up to 20 or more spotted flowers on a greenish-yellow background and that are over an inch in diameter and smell like honey. These flowers are produced on a foot-long inflorescence. Grobya galeata is similar, but inflorescences are longer and produce more than twice the number of flowers; these however, are about half as large. The genus was named in honor of Lord Grey of Groby, England, an avid orchid grower and patron of horticulture.",
