Vanda,Jones 1820,"VAN-duh (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Vandeae 
Subtribe: Aeridinae


With the publication of Genera Orchidacearum volume 6, the tribe Vandeae has been revised. Many familiar genera are now included in Vanda. Those genera still have listings in Orchids A to Z under their previous name with notation indicating their inclusion in Vanda. Among those now included in Vanda are Ascocentrum, Christensonia, Euanthe and Neofinetia. 

The derivation of the name Vanda comes from the Sanskrit word referring to the plant we now know as V. tessellata. These popular plants are found in tropical areas, requiring lots of bright light, plenty of water, warm temperatures (an exception being V. coerulea which is native to higher elevations) and high humidity. The flowers are showy and colorful and when hybridized with Ascocentrum to produce Ascocenda, available in just about every color imaginable. 

Taxonomically it is a genus rife with confusion and many species have been (are in some cases still are) treated as separate genera an example being V. sanderiana which is also known as Euanthe sanderiana (for specific information on this species see Euanthe) to the disagreement of some taxonomists. Although now known as Papilionanthe, the terete-leaved P. teres was not long ago known as Vanda teres. 

Vanda species are generally tall monopodial plants that usually bloom but once a year. Combined with Ascocentrum, plants that bloom several times a year are produced. The leaves are strap-shaped as opposed to the pencil shape of Papilionanthe species. The leaves of Vanda usually have erose (uneven and irregular) cut tips. The flowers which range in size from 1 to about 4 inches are very popular. Many of the species are very fragrant and the flowers long lasting. Much hybridizing is being done with many of the species that were relatively unknown a short time ago. Thus in collections, it is easy to find commonly grown species such as V. coerulea and V. denisoniana growing beside some of the lesser known species such as V. dearei, V. lamellata or V. merrillii.",Currently the World Monocot Checklist recognizes 80species and 4 natural hybrids. Several species have recognized varietal forms or subspecies as well.

Vandopsis,Pfitzer 1889,"van-DOP-sis (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Vandeae 
Subtribe: Aeridinae


In 1850 Ernst H.H. Pfitzer named the genus Vandopsis using the Sanskrit word vanda (a reference to Vanda tessellata) and the Greek word opsis (looks like) due to its similar appearance to the genus Vanda. These slow-growing tropical epiphytes are robust and erect in growth habit and can grow to several feet in height. The fleshy leaves are strap-shaped and can grow to 24 inches in length. 

The flowers are showy and long-lasting, up to 3 or 4 months (Vandopsis lissochiloides). Sheehan has compared the firm, heavy substance of the sequentially produced flowers to a ‘banana peel’. The flowers are yellow and spotted with brown or purplish blotches. On a well-grown plant, the inflorescence can reach 6 feet in length. The genus is allied to Arachnis and Trichoglottis and some of the species previously relegated to Vandopsis have been transferred to these and other related genera. Vandopsis gigantea is the species most commonly found in hobbyist and commercial collections.",The World Monocot Checklist currently recognizes 4 distinct species.

Vanilla,Plum. ex Mill. 1754,"va-NIL-luh (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Vanilleae 
Subtribe: Vanillinae


Vanilla belongs to a group that includes some of the most primitive orchids. The name is derived from the Spanish word vainilla meaning small pod and is characterized by vine-like plants that climb and branch. A leaf and short roots that attach to tree trunks and branches are present at each node. The flowers, produced from congested racemes opposite the leaf axils, are large and showy and short-lived, but produced in succession so that the plant is attractive for weeks or even months at a time. Vanilla is one of the few orchids, other than those grown for the cut flower trade, with widespread commercial use. V. planifolia is widely cultivated for its long, slender, fleshy pods that are essential for the manufacture of vanilla flavoring. 
In addition to its commercial value, the presence of fleshy, fragrant seed pods and seed with a hard seed coat may also prove indispensible to the understanding of orchid evolution. These characteristics suggest animal-mediated seed dispersal. Recent research has established the pollinator to be a Euglossine bee (also called Orchid Bees) consistent with the pollination of many very fragrant orchids in the neotropics. However, it has also been reported that the seed capsules are eaten by bats thereby effecting seed dispersal. 
The pantropical yet isolated distribution of Vanilla, coupled with the ephemeral nature of the flowers has given rise to significant confusion as to the number of species in the genus.
