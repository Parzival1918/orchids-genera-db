L. Blume. It has often been misspelled as Acanthophippium and the various species have been scientifically described with both spellings. The species have prominent, tapered bulbs that are up to 15 cm long and 5 cm wide and have large plicate leaves. The flowers are very unusual being bottle or cup-shaped somewhat like a tulip, waxy, and have a very strong fragrance. They have a wide range of colors mostly being shades of orange, red and yellow. The name Acanthophippium is a combination of two Greek words, akanthe, meaning spur or thorn, and ephippion, meaning saddle. These refer to the shape and structure of the blade of the lip. The type species is Aca. javanicum. Commonly grown species are Aca. mantinianum; Aca. javanicum; Aca. striatum.",

Although I cannot remember the exact date, I can remember the plant that made such a striking impression on me. I came face to face with it growing as a low-level epiphyte in a dense thicket of trees and shrubs near the river at about 8,000 feet above sea level, just north of the Equator. Several inflorescences were in full flower; their pristine white blooms with long curving nectaries, or spurs, presented a most elegant sight. Later I discovered that it was Aergs. thomsonii. Thus my interest in this attractive genus began and still continues today.\u00a0\n\r\nThe name Aerangis was coined from two Greek words, aer, air and angos, vessel, and was probably a reference to the nectariferous spur at the base of the lip. Plants allocated to this genus today are among the most attractive of the white-flowered vandaceous orchids of Africa and its adjacent islands, including Madagascar. \u00a0\n\r\nMany species of Aerangis were first described under the name Angraecum. It was in 1865 that H.G. Reichenbach proposed the genus Aerangis, separating it from Angraecum on account of the long slender rostellum that stretches forward from below the column apex, across the stigmatic surface, and by the long slender stipe that is located on the upper surface of this rostellum and supports the two pollinia.\u00a0\n\r\nA major contribution to the recognition of the genus was that of the German botanist Rudolf Schlechter. In 1914 he transferred some of the well-known Madagascar species from Angraecum to Aerangis and in 1918 made an important review of all the African angraecoid orchids that dealt with an additional 11 species of Aerangis. More species have been added to the genus since then.\u00a0\n\r\nSpecies most commonly found in cultivation include Aergs. articulata, Aergs. biloba, Aergs. citrata, Aergs. ellisii, Aergs. fastuosa, Aergs. luteo-alba and its variety rhodosticta, and Aergs. modesta.",

Its name is a latinized form of the Malayan word angurek which is used to describe orchids with a growth habit similar to the genus Vanda. Angraecums, approximately two hundred species of white or greenish, generally star-shaped flowers, are typically monopodial in growth habit and are mostly epiphytic.

The plants are similar in that they are formed of upright clusters of slender, cigar-shaped pseudobulbs crowned with five to seven leaves that may be held generally upright to slightly arching. The leaves are evenly broad along their length, tapering to a roundly pointed tip. Leaves are generally medium green, while the pseudobulbs range from greenish cream to a mustardy yellow color. Smaller forms range from 12\u201d \u2013 18\u201d tall, while some of the larger, more southerly forms may attain 48\u201d or more in height.
