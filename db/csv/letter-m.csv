Macodes,Lindl. 1840,"ma-KO-deez (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Erythrodeae 
Subtribe: Goodyerinae


Macodes is one of the genus of fabulous ‘jewel orchids’ – orchids with veined foliage more beautiful than the rather non-descript flowers, although a well-bloomed specimen with many inflorescences is a sight to behold. Described by John Lindley in 1840, Macodes is closely allied to Ludisia and Goodyera. Its name is derived from the Greek word macros (long) probably an allusion to the elongated mid-lobe of the lip.

Macradenia,R. Brown 1822,"mak-rah-DEEN-ee-ah (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Cymbidieae
Subtribe: Oncidiinae


Although Macradenia flowers are non-resupinate (lip carried upper-most), this presents no problem as far as the pollinator is concerned. The inflorescence, which usually starts out growing erect, soon becomes pendent as it elongates, placing the flowers in the proper position for pollination (M. lutescens). This small genus was first described by Brown in 1822. He coined the genus name Macradenia from the Greek words markos (long) and aden (gland) to describe the long stipe that connects the pollinia to the viscidium.

Vegetatively, these sympodial epiphytic plants form clumps of almost cylindrical, slightly tapered pseudobulbs up to 2 inches (5 cm) tall, usually with basal sheaths or papery remains on the old pseudobulbs. Each pseudobulb is topped by a single, thick, fleshy to leathery leaf up to 7 inches (17.5 cm) long. The pendent inflorescence arises from the base of the pseudobulb and may bear up to 25 1-inch-wide flowers. The base flower colors are maroon, yellow and white. The petals and sepals of Macradenia flowers are basically alike in size, shape and color, with the petals sometimes slightly narrower than the sepals. The three-lobed, almost fleshy lip has a narrow, elongated, sharply pointed midlobe that may be strongly recurved or almost straight. The lip also bears a disc that may have one to three central keels or a thickened central ridge. The two broader side lobes almost clasp the column. Species in cultivation: M. brassavolae, M. lutescens, and M. multiflora.",The World Monocot Checklist currently recognizes 11 species.,Florida south through Mexico and West Indies to northern South America.
Malaxis,Swartz 1778,"mal-AX-iss (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Malaxideae 
Subtribe:


Malaxis is a large genus of terrestrial orchids with variation in vegetative growth. All have minuscule nonresupinate flowers. The genus was first described in 1788 by O. Swartz, who selected the Greek word malaxis (softening) as the generic name. He was probably referring to the soft succulent leaves found on some species, or possibly to the fact that some leaves instead of drying out at the end of their lives turn light tan, become soft and collapse (M. latifolia). The genus was revised in 1889. Some species have extremely wide distribution ranges, for instance Malaxis unifolia is found from eastern Canada southward through the central and eastern United States and into the Caribbean and Malaxis monophyllos ranges throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere to the Philippines. Other species may be endemic (found only in a single area) to a single island. Examples of the latter are Malaxis rhabdophylla found on the island of New Guinea and Malaxis aurata found on the island of Borneo. Malaxis is closely related to Liparis, but is separated by having nonresupinate flowers.

Vegetatively, these sympodial plants vary greatly. Some are miniatures less than 6 inches (15 cm) tall. Other species have pseudobulbs up to 6 inches (15 cm) tall. In some species the variable inflorescences are densely covered with small flowers, each of which is seldom over a few millimeters in diameter. The base flower colors are greens and creams, but there are a few with pink or purplish pink flowers.

The small flowers, often only ¼ inch (5mm) across vary between and among species with the greatest variation being in the lip. The sepals and petals are similar in length and color, but vary in width, with one broader than the other. The floral segments may be flat, reflexed or somewhat twisted. The lips may have midlobes either larger or smaller than the side lobes with or without auricles. The margin of the lip may be entire or toothed. Some lips are broadly trilobed, bilobed or bifid. Species found in cultivation include: M. acuminata, M. calophylla, and M. monophyllos.",The World Monocot Checklist currently recognizes 410 species and numerous named varietal forms.

Masdevallia,Ruiz & Pavón 1794,"maz-deh-VAL-ee-uh (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Epidendreae 
Subtribe: Pleurothallidinae


Masdevallia is a spectacular genus that contains more than 300 recognized species. Most grow epiphytically at high elevations and cool greenhouse conditions are a must for many of the species. Some will tolerate intermediate conditions and a few people have had luck with the warmth tolerant varieties as far south as Florida. The unusual, brilliantly colored flowers range in size from less than an inch to over 12 inches across. Flower color varies. White, red and purple combinations are common. An inflorescence will usually have 1 flower although some species will have several. The genus was named in honor of the Spanish botanist and physician, José Masdeval in 1794 and was widely collected in the first part of the 19th century. By the mid 1800’s over 50 species were already known. Masdevallia is allied to Pleurothallis, differing mainly in showier flowers and having sepals that unite at the base to form a narrow bell-shaped tube. 

Taxonomic work on the genus continues and most recently Carlyle Luer, MD has proposed the segregation of an additional 19 genera. Masdevallia continues to contain the bulk of the species with 225 currently. Alternatively, Genera Orchidacearum/Monocot Checklist continues to regard them all as Masdevallia. Species most commonly found in cultivation include the spectacular M. coccinea, M. racemosa (Luer’s Spectaculum racemosum), M. uniflora, M. triangularis, M. tovarensis (Luer’s Alaticaulia), M. strobelii, M. saltatrix, M. rosea, M. infracta (Alaticaulia), M. ignea and M. floribunda (Luer’s Acinopetala).

Maxillaria,Ruiz & Pavón 1794,"max-ih-LARE-ee-uh (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Maxillarieae 
Subtribe: Maxillariinae


Maxillaria, epiphytes with a sympodial growth habit, is one of the largest genera of New World orchids. The generic name is derived from the Latin maxilla (jawbone) since the lip and column resemble the jaws of insects. Botanists seem to agree that there are two major groups in the genus based on how the pseudobulbs are arranged. One group consists of species with tightly clustered tufts, psedobulbless according to some (e.g. M. cucullata).The other group is made up of species with longer internodes and rhizomes of varying lengths (e.g. M. tenuifolia). It remains to be seen if taxonomists continue to regard both of these groups as pieces of a single genus or decide that the genus is a cosmopolitan assemblage and continue to create additional segregate genera. Most species of Maxillaria have only one leaf but some species have up to four. The inflorescence is one flowered with some species producing clusters of inflorescences from the base of each individual pseudobulb. Flower size ranges broadly from ½ inch to over 6 inches in diameter. Regardless of the size, all flowers of the different species have 3 sepals, similar in size, color and triangular shape and two petals, much smaller than the sepals. Some maxillarias are fragrant, such as the popular M. tenuifolia, commonly known as the coconut orchid because of its coconut-like fragrance. 

Many of the species once considered belonging to Maxillaria have been removed to allied genera such as Lycaste, Xylobium, Ornithidium, Camaridium and Pseudomaxillaria. Maxillaria is a genus found mostly in specialty collections although M. tenuifolia is more widespread and often found even in beginners’ collections because of its beautiful fragrance and ease of growth.","It is highly probable that Maxillaria contains more than one genus. As a result, some authors recognize up to 700 or more species while others recognize far fewer.

Mediocalcar,J.J. Smith 1900,"Mee-dee-oh-CAL-car (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Dendrobieae 
Subtribe: Glomerinae


A genus of miniature mound- or mat-forming, sometimes vining species with creeping rhizomes, small but distinct pseudobulbs and succulent leaves, distinguished by the rounded bell- or Christmas ornament-shaped flowers in bright reds or oranges tipped with pink, white, yellow or green. The name Mediocalcar comes from the Latin medium = middle and calcar = spur in reference to the protrusion of the middle part of the lip. The type species Mediocalcar bicolor (now a synonym of Mediocalcar paradoxum subsp. robustum) is red with white petal and sepal tips. Mediocalcar decoratum, which is most often found for sale, has 6mm candy corn-colored, globe-shaped flowers that explode open at the apical end to reveal a tiny column and even tinier pointed lip. The species of this genus grow throughout the year with their most active growth occurring during the cooler temperatures. Growth simply slows or stops if the plant is kept too warm. The leaves are succulent so the plants can withstand some drying but this results in wrinkling of the leaves and is not necessary for flowering. Mediocalcar decoratum blooms late summer or fall and often blooms twice a year.","The World Checklist of Monocotyledons recognizes 17 species. Some examples are: agathodaemonis, bifolium, congestum, decoratum, paradoxum, pygmaeum, uniflorum, umboiense, versteegii.

Miltonia,Lindl. 1837,"Mil-TONE-ee-ah (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Cymbidieae 
Subtribe: Oncidiinae


The Genus Miltonia was described in 1837 by John Lindley based on the Brazilian species Miltonia spectabilis, principally found in Brazil. For taxonomical and cultural purposes, this genus is split into two distinct genera: warmer growing Miltonia (Brazilian) and cooler growing Miltoniopsis (Colombian) often referred to as the ""Pansy Orchid"". The Registration Authority continues to treat both genera as Miltonia for registration and, as a result, it is very important to understand the actual genus involved in many older hybrids to effectively understand their culture. The growth habit, cultivation and flower habit for each genus is substantially different. The smaller flowers of Miltonia (except for spectabilis) are quite starry compared to Miltoniopsis, and the color patterns can be very complex. This entire genus is closely allied to Oncidium, Odontoglossum and Brassia and there are many complex hybrids consisting of all or some of these genera as well as others.","he World Checklist of Monocotyledons recognizes 11 species and 4 natural hybrids in the genus Miltonia. Examples are: candida, clowesii, cuneata, flavescens, regnellii, russelliana, and spectabilis. The Checklist recognizes 5 species of Miltoniopsis: bismarkii, phalaenopsis, roezlii, and vexillaria.","Miltonias are primarily from Brazil, while Miltoniopsis are from the cooler regions of Costa Rica, Panama, Venezuela, Ecuador and Columbia."
Miltoniopsis,Godefroy-Lebeuf 1889,"mil-toh-nee-OPP-sis (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Maxillarieae 
Subtribe: Oncidiinae


Miltoniopsis are commonly known as ‘pansy orchids’ because of the similarity of the flowers to pansies. As with many orchids, the genus name has led a confused life. Although given generic recognition in 1889 when Alexandre Godefroy-Lebeuf described M. vexillaria, most botanists continued to lump Miltonia with Miltoniopsis until the mid 1970’s. Yet the differences between the two genera are distinctive despite the historical confusion. Miltoniopsis have but one leaf at the apex of the pseudobulb whereas Miltonia have two; the pseudobulbs of Miltoniopsis are rounded, laterally compressed, and clustered tightly together whereas Miltonia pseudobulbs are more eleongate and more widely spaced. In addition, the pseudobulbs and foliage of most species of Miltoniopsis are a rather gray-green while those of Miltonia are a most typical yellow-green to mid-green. There are also differences in the column of the two genera. Another major difference is that Miltonia are found in Brazil while Miltoniopsis range from Costa Rica to Ecuador and Venezuela. The genus is closely allied to Brassia, Odontoglossum and Oncidium, and the plants when not in flower are often difficult to distinguish. In cool and intermediate greenhouses M. phalaenopsis, M. roezlii and M. vexillaria are popular species, especially in the Pacific Northwest and higher elevation areas of Hawaii.

To add to the confusion, hybrids of Miltoniopsis are still registered as Miltonia although that may change in the near future.

Mormodes,Lindley 1836,"more-MO-dez (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Cymbidieae 
Subtribe: Catasetinae


Mormodes is an epiphytic genus ranging from sea level to 800 meters that seems to favor dead or rotting branches. This leads to many plants being found growing on the ground when the limbs break. The name of the genus comes from two Greek words that mean “phantom” and “resembling”. They are frequently called “goblin orchids” in English. Their name is based on the very strange lip shape and the relationship of the column to the lip. The lip is frequently reflexed in two or three sections with the column twisted to one side with the back resting on the lip. Mormodes are usually considered to bear perfect or bisexual flowers with both pollen and a stigma in the column. Like Clowesia and Dressleria, however, the stigma will not accept fertilization until the pollen has been removed. After the pollen is removed, the column straightens and raises back from the column to expose the stigma for pollination. A vegetative feature that distinguishes Mormodes from the other Catasetinae is that the inflorescences generally originate from the middle or lower nodes of the pseudobulbs. Another difference from the other Catasetinae is that the inflorescences of Mormodes project straight out or upward from the pseudobulb. There is less published information about Mormodes than about the other Catasetinae. In a subtribe that abounds with strange features, Mormodes may be the strangest of all. Some Mormodes species produce different types of flowers referred to as female-dominant, male-dominant and normal hermaphroditic or bisexual flowers. This variation in flower shapes and sizes on the same species has confused the identification of many species. There are also indications that a few species do produce on occasion small male flowers with only pollen and a vestigial stigma. The so-called female-dominate flowers are larger and heavier than the male-dominant or normal bisexual flowers. Although the flower has pollen, it probably would function well only as the recipient of pollen from another flower. Mormodes sinuata, M. rolfeanum, M. variabilis, Mormodes revolutum, and the newer species described from Brazil are among species readily available in cultivation. The red species of Mormodes make them popular in intergeneric hybridization. The most highly awarded among this group is Cycnodes Wine Delight.",The World Monocot Checklist contains 81 accepted names (9/2007).,Mexico to Brazil and Bolivia

Mormolyca is a genus of epiphytic orchids described by John Lindley in 1849 as Trigonidium ringens and transferred to Mormolyca in 1914 by R. Schlecter. The species have pseudobulbs up to 8 cm tall that are seperated by a short rhizome. They carry 1 to 4 leaves. The inflorescences are produced from the bases of the pseudobulbs or the axils of bracts on the rhizome and are single-flowered. The name Mormolyca is the Greek word mormolyca, which means hobgoblin ( an ugly or grotesque sprite that is mischievous and sometimes evil and malicious). This is an illusion to the appearance of the flower when viewed from the side. The type species is Mormolyca ringens.

Species of the genus Myoxanthus are very closely allied with the genus Pleurothallis. The name derives from mys = muscle and xanthos = yellow, in reference to the fleshy, red-brown sepals of the type species. The stem sheaths are usually covered with short stiff hairs and the single, often fuzzy, flowers may appear clustered. The species are found epiphytically and lithophytically in moist cloud forests at altitudes of 50 m (160 feet) to 3,200 m (10,500 feet) with most in the 1,200 m (4,000 foot) to 2,500 m (8,200 foot) range. Some species can be up to 3 feet tall.
