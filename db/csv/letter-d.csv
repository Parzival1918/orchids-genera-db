Dactylorhiza,Necker 1937,"dak-til-o-RISE-ah (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Arethuseae
Subtribe: Bletiinae

Terrestrial plants, with two palmate tuberoids and generally cauline leaves. Unbranched stem, 1--100 cm high. Inflorescence cylindrical, densely flowered. Flowers purple, plin, yellow and more rarely brown or white. Lip entire or three-lobed, with a spur, lateral sepals generally spread. The name Dactylorhiza derives from daktylos = finger and rhiza = root, in reference to the knotted, finger like roots.

Because of their spectacular colorful inflorescences and their relative ease of cultivation, Dactylorhizas are the most widely grown European orchids. Artificial ""improved"" hybrids can even be found in specialized nurseries. They should not be confused with Orchis, and are easily distinguished by the round tuberoids of this genus.

Dactylorhizas grow in marshes, grasslands or woodlands. Pollinators are insects.

Type species: Dactylorhiza umbrosa (Kar. & Kir.) Neveski

Warning: the plants should never be collected in the wild, but only purchased from authorized dealers which can certify culture from seeds.", ,"This is another genus in which natural hybridization occurs with relative easy, leading to great confusion in the taxonomy of the genus. At the present time, The World Checklist of Monocotyledons recognizes 45 species and numerous named botanical varieties as well as 81 natural hybrids."

Tribe: Epidendreae
Subtribe: Dendrobiinae

Section Amblyanthus was established by Schlechter in 1905 with species recorded from New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Schlechter expanded the Section to nine species from New Guinea in 1912. One species from Borneo has also been described, D. microglaphis Rchb.f. Amblyanthus is considered to be a poorly known section, but most closely related to Section Breviflores. Amblyanthus has a short or abbreviated inflorescence and has prominent dry, thin, membranous basal sheaths and floral bracts, which are characterized as having a ""scale-like"" external texture of the inflorescence. The species show very little variation within the section and are fairly uniform in their habit. Most of the species are found in montane, mist forests and grow down low on tree trunks in low to moderate elevations. The stems start out erect and become pendulous with length. The papery leaves appear in pairs mostly on the apical half of the stem. The flowers are lateral with 2 to 12 flowers on an inflorescence, depending on species. The fleshy flowers are generally slow in maturing and then last only a few days up to two weeks. Most flowers are yellowish-brown on the outside and may be covered in scales or short, black hairs on outside of sepals. Flowers are generally white on the inside with a yellow lip; they may have orange to red streaks in the lip. The lip is usually 3-lobed with a distinctive fleshy, flange-like basal appendage. Flowers range from approximately .5 to one inch across and some species have flowers which do not open well. Although this section is not popularly grown, the most commonly known are D. squamiferum, D. melanostictum, and D. microglaphys. Species in this section should be given regular watering all year long with slightly less water in the winter. Provide intermediate to warm conditions with medium to moderately bright light.", ,"Approximately 12 - 14 species: D. melanostictum, D. kempterianum (possibly synonymous with D. squamiferum), D. bismarckiense, D. microglaphys, D. canthomeson, D. quadriferum, D. cavipes, D. squamiferum, D. furfuriferum, D. zippelii and D. gibiense."

Initially, this group of plants was established as a genus by Carl Blume in 1825 while Dr. John Lindley classified them as a section of the genus Dendrobium. Recent DNA studies suggest that Blume’s generic concept may be correct. The flowers are generally small as are the plants. The laterally flattened leaves are a distinguishing feature of this group. Members of this group are usually only seen in specialist collections although Den. anceps is often grown for its foliage in warm climates.",Approximately 50 species.,"Throughout South East Asia, with two centres of distribution, one is in Myanmar and the other in Borneo. "
Den. Sec. Australorchis,(Brieger) Dockrill,"au-stral-OR-kiss (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Epidendreae
Subtribe: Dendrobiinae

Dendrobium Section Australorchis contains only four species, all from Eastern and North-Eastern Australia. They are epiphytic, or occasionally lithophytic, occurring from low to moderate altitudes. They grow on trees and rocks in bright light, fluctuating humidity with good air movement. Habitats include rainforest, open forest, woodland, coastal scrubs and rocky areas. Their climate varies from tropical to subtropical. In the tropics, the majority of rain falls during the Australian summer wet season from December to March with the remaining months being much drier and having sporadic or intermittent rain. The plants are densely matted with short, thick and hard pseudobulbs. Rhizomes are very short. The plants have tough, flat, one to three leaves that are longer than wide with unusual notched tips. Few to many star-shaped or cupped flowers are carried on long inflorescences. The flowers have a prominent mentum and a three-lobed lip. The small flowers are 0.7 to 1.5 cm wide and last only several days. Flowers may be white, yellow, or orange colored and may be scented. Flowering is usually in the Australian Autumn and Spring. The Section is most closely related to Dendrocoryne. Brieger in 1981 considered Australorchis to be a separate genus from Dendrobium.","4 species: D. monophyllum (type species), D. carrii, D. schneiderae, D. eungellensis (6/2007)","Queensland and Northern New South Wales, Australia "

Dendrobium Section Calcarifera was originally described by J. J. Smith in 1908 and reintroduced by J. B. Comber in 1983. Until recently, this section was largely included in section Pedilonum. Most of the mainland Asian species previously placed in the latter section are now placed in S. Calcarifera. Species in this section are medium sized epiphytes which occur from low to moderate elevations requiring warm to intermediate conditions in areas with year around rainfall. Characteristically, species in this section have fleshy stems or pseudobulbs, with leaves occurring in two ranks along the stems and are deciduous after a year or more. The flowers have a long, curved mentum and a more membranous lip that is moderately broad with a claw that narrows sharply at the base. The lip usually has some form of projection on the claw, but no keels or warts on the blade of the lip. The lip is more or less continuous with the base of the column foot which forms a short spur. The flowers occur singly or in short, pendulous inflorescences hanging laterally from the stems of both leafy and leafless stems.",approx. 50 – 60 species,"Asia, Borneo, Java, New Guinea, Philippines, with Borneo apparently the Center of distribution with 21 species. "

Species in this Section are included by some taxonomists in Section Oxyglossum and are similar in appearance to Section Calyptrochilus, but with shorter stems. Species may be identified by upturned sidelobes of the lip, which is blunt at the apex. The small plants have short, thick pseudobulbs and few leaves at the apex. Flowers are large for the plant size and long-lasting. Colors are variable and bright with one to two flowers on each inflorescence. The species grow in cooler climates at generally higher alpine habitats where they are exposed to strong air movement and do not tolorate lowland, tropical conditions. Den. laevifolium and Den. prasinum are a little more warmth tolerant than the popular Den. cuthbertsonii, but all species in this section are intolerant of long, hot, dry conditions.

This is the type section for the genus and includes Dendrobium moniliforme, the type species. The Section Dendrobium is related to Sections Calcarifera, Pedilonum and Formosae. Most of the plants of this section are epiphytes that are found in low to moderate elevations in areas that have a very distinct dry seasons.

The plants often have club-shaped pseudobulbs with leaves along the upper two-thirds. Usually deciduous, these leaves will often fall off after a year and these bare canes will produce flowers, usually one to three, at nodes along the canes during the dry season. The flowers are often large and showy and sometimes fragrant, such as Den. anosmum (syn. superbum) which has a strong raspberry scent. In general, these species require a cool dry rest in order to flower well.

Some of the plants in this section are among the most cultivated in Australia, and throughout the world. Dendrobium kingianum< is my personal favorite of all the orchids. It is an attractive, neat plant, which produces an array of beautiful, long lasting, fragrant flowers in colors of white, white with colored lip, pale yellow, and splash, and plain petal flowers in shades of mauve, pink, and purple.

Notes on culture:
In Australia plants from this section are frequently grown in saucers. I use a plastic, azalea type pot, and a bark mix consisting of seven parts of 50/50 medium and fine fir bark, to which is added one part each of charcoal, coarse perlite, chunky peat, and, if available, medium tree fern.

I try to keep the plants tight in the pot, and this may require potting up every year. When potting up, I do not disturb the roots any more than necessary. If repotting is needed this is done after flowering, and before new growth starts. These are neat plants and need very little grooming. Like all dendrobiums these will form keikis, and this is variable and is a function of genetics and has little if anything to do with culture. The current year's keikis should be left on the plant as they will contribute to flower production. After flowering, however, all keikis should be removed as keikis will form keikis and the keikis will form keikis and eventually there will be a veritable weed patch. At the time of removal there should be adequate roots so that the keikis may be potted up, and they are interesting in that most will produce a new growth, perhaps another keiki, and the following season all may flower, i.e. the original keiki, the new growth, and the new keiki. Some keikis, however, remain small and are slow to develop roots, those from 'Karl Marx', for example, and when removed behave like seedlings out of flask and may need 3-5 years before flowering. A few inflorescences will start out in the normal way, but will develop a bulbous base like a new growth, and develop roots, but flower without any leaves forming. Some, but not all of these can be removed and potted up like keikis and will put out new growth.

The name is derived from macro meaning large and clados (klados) meaning twig or branch. These terrestrial orchids have tall, slender cane-like stems.The section Macrocladium is in the Subgenus Xerobium, which is described as plants with stems that are wiry, dry, and always slender. Some taxonomists have moved most of the species in this section to the Genus Cannaeorchis Clem. & Jones with one species Den. winika moved to the monotypic genus, Winika. The species in this section are terrestrial and are large branching plants which are ""bamboo-like"". They grow in low to moderate altitudes in areas of scrubland or at the edges of stunted forests, where there is high light and a marked seasonal variation. The stems are wiry, greatly elongated (4 to 5 meters) and branched. Leaves are narrow, and alternately arranged in two ranks along the length of the stem. The small to medium flowers are one to many on an inflorescence and are formed on the youngest growths. Lip is tri-lobed with several ridges along the surface and distinctive side lobes. The flowers have a prominent mentum. They are related to Section Kinetochilus and to the Genus Grastidium.

The Section Microphytanthe is in Subgenus Athecebium, which is described as plants without distinct sheaths at the the base. This is a small section occuring in moderate to high altitudes. They grow in montane rainforests on trunks or major branched of trees. Plants are small with creeping rhizomes, which are similar to bulbophyllums. Like bulbophyllums, they have single-node, well-spaced pseudobulbs and a single terminal leaf. As the name implies, although the flowers are small, they are quite large for the plant size and a mature, well-grown plant may have numerous flowers. The singular flowers form on the apex of the pseudobulbs and may be yellow, orange, or maroon. Flowers may last one to three weeks. Plants of this section are related to Section Lichenastrum.

This relatively small group of sympodial, mostly epiphytic, tropical orchids contains several species of great beauty and horticultural importance. Den. phalaenopsis, the Cooktown Orchid, occurs only in the south-eastern portion of Cape York Peninsula, Queensland, but for many years this name has been erroneously applied to an Indonesian species, now correctly known as Den. striaenopsis. Both Den. phalaenopsis and Den. striaenopsis have been widely cultivated, and in combination with Den. bigibbum, another north Queensland native, have figured prominently in the breeding of ""hardcane"" Dendrobium hybrids, much favoured by orchid growers. In sect. Phalaenanthe, pseudobulbs may be tall (up to 80 cm.) and slender (e.g. Den. bigibbum), or short and stout (e.g. Den. lithicola), with up to 6 apical and subapical leaves. The erect, arching inflorescences arise from nodes near the top of the pseudobulbs, and carry up to a dozen large, showy, pansy-shaped flowers, in tones of white, pink and purple.

Cultural requirements of this large and complex genus depend on the native habitat of the species in question and the section of the genus to which it belongs. Please refer to the different sections of Dendrobium for cultural information",Over 1000 species,"Tropical and subtropical Asia throughout the islands of the south Pacific Ocean and southward through New Guinea and Australia.

Tribe: Coelogyneae
Subtribe: Coelogyninae


Carl Blume established this genus of sympodial orchids in 1825. The generic epithet is from the Greek dendron = tree and cheilos = lip, referring to the epiphytic habit and, in some species, the conspicuous labellum. Type species for this genus is Dendrochilum aurantiacum. The majority of the species are small-growing plants from elevations over 1,000 metres. The flowers, though small, are usually produced in great profusion. Commonly grown species are Dendrochilum cobbianum, Dendrochilum filiforme and Dendrochilum glumaceum.",The World Checklist of Monocotyledons recognizes 313 accepted names (9/2007).,"Throughout South East Asia, Taiwan and New Guinea.

Tribe: Vandeae
Subtribe: Angraecinae

One of those mysterious, leafless orchids, Dendrophylax is closely related to the other leafless, Neotropical orchids, Campylocentrum, and Harrisella (considered by the World Monocot Checklist to be synonymous with Dendrophylax). Recently Polyradicion (syn. Polyrrhiza) has been sunk into synonymy with Dendrophylax, so Florida’s famous Ghost Orchid is now properly called Dendrophylax lindenii. The genus name is derived from the Greek dendron, tree and phylax, guard, most likely in reference to the roots which tightly bind to tree branches. Leafless orchids have evolved densely clustered root masses that not only take in the moisture and nutrients but also contain chlorophyll necessary for photosynthesis. This effectively makes leaves unnecessary. In some leafless orchids, small seedlings do produce rudimentary leaves for short periods and many continue to do so even as adults. In other species, leaves are never observed.

Although not common in hobbyist collections due to (presumed) cultural difficulty, Dendrophylax and the other leafless orchids always create interest. In 2006 a plant of D. lindenii caused quite a stir among the judges at the Florida-Caribbean Judging Center. This beautifully bloomed plant received an 89 point Award of Merit for flower quality.- quite a feat since most orchidists have never seen a leafless orchid in bloom.","The WCSP currently recognizes 12 species.

Dimerandra,Schlechter 1922,"dye-mer-ANN-druh (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Epidendreae
Subtribe: Laeliinae


Solitary, flat, showy flowers atop thin leafy reedlike stems or even atop leafless dry stems typify plants of Dimerandra. This small genus is widespread throughout the New World Tropics. Originally, the first known species was classified as Oncidium marginata by C. F. W. Myers in 1818 but later transferred to Epidendrum by Hooker. Hooker could not conserve the specific name because Ruiz and Pavón had already given that name to another Epidendrum species hence it became E. stenopetalum. In 1922 Schlechter transferred them to Dimerandra. He coined the generic name from three Greek words, di (two), merus (part) and andra (stamen) to describe the two large lobes on the clinandrium (that part of the column where the anther is located). Dimerandra is readily separated from the other members of the tribe by its two vertical parallel wings on the column that extend beyond the apex of the column.

Vegetatively, these sympodial epiphytes form clumps of erect leafy reedlike growths up to 16 inches (40 cm) tall. The leathery linear-oblong leaves are up to 6 inches (15 cm) long and ½ inch (1.25 cm) wide. The leaf bases clasp the stem. The short terminal inflorescence has few flowers with usually one flower open at a time. Ocasionally flowers will develop atop leafless canes encased in brown papery leaf bases. The base color of these 1-1/2 inch (3.5 cm) flowers is light to dark magenta-pink. The flowers have sepals and petals that are much alike in shape and color. The species most often found in cultivation is D. emarginata", ,The World Monocot Checklist currently recognizes 4 species. (8/2007)

Dipteranthus,Barbosa-Rodrigues 1882,"dip-ter-ANN-thus (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Maxillarieae
Subtribe: Ornithocephalinae


If space is a problem, then Dipteranthus is the genus to grow. This group of miniature orchids can be grown on small plaques or little twigs where their pendent inflorescences of small colorful flowers can be displayed to advantage. This South American genus is subject to some discussion taxonomically. Some taxonomists view it as consisting of about 12 distinct species while the World Monocot Checklist has reduced them all to synonym with Zygostates. Barbosa-Rodrigues first described the genus in 1881. The generic name was formed by combining two Greek words, dipterous (two-winged insect or fly) and anthos (flower), probably in reference to the knat-like appearance of some of the tiny flowers in this genus. Like many miniature orchids they produce large numbers of flowers and it is easy to see why Barbosa-Rodrigues would compare them to a swarm of knats.

Vegetatively, these sympodial epiphytic plants form tight clusters of miniature pseudobulbs. The individual pseudobulbs may be no more than 0.12 inches (3 to 4 mm) tall. Each has one leaf at the apex and one or more lateral leaves sheathing the pseudobulbs. The individual thick leaves are almost lanceceolate and up to 1-1/2 inches (4 cm) long. The short pendent inflorescences arise from the base of the pseudobulb and bear from a few to many small flowers about ½ inches (1 cm) in diameter in most species. The base flower colors are yellow, green and white.

The tiny flowers of Dipteranthus have three sepals that are alike in shape and color. The petals are often slightly darker in color and broader than the sepals and may have an erose margin. The top half of the petals may be folded back. The small lip, appearing bowl-shaped in face view and more canoe-shaped in side view, has a round tuft of hairs where the callus is normally found. Names in cultivation include 
D. estradae and D. planifolius both now synonyms for Zygostates apiculata.

Disa,P.J. Bergius 1767,"DYE-sa or DEE-sa (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Arethuseae
Subtribe: Bletiinae

In orchid literature there are two pronunciations cited, (DYE-sa) may have come from the Latin, dis, (rich) in an allusion to it's beautiful flowers and (DEE-sah) alluding to the mythical Queen Disa of Sweden who was wrapped in a fishing net: the dorsal sepal of the the type species, D. uniflora, is ""net""-veined.

Disas are terrestrial orchids with tuberous roots and are sympodial. Leaf size varies within the genus, forming rosettes as the base of the plant and the flowering shoot emerges from the center of the rosette. Flower size is variable for the genus, from the ¾"" sized many flowered species, to the fewer flowered species D. uniflora with flowers approximately 4"" or even larger. Colors range from white, yellow, orange, red, pinks, lavender, and the rare blue. The sepals are the largest and showiest part of the flower, and the dorsal sepal is often marked with some sort of pattern consisting of spotting or striping.

Disas exhibit 3 different types of vegetative growth. The most common is the shoot that forms off of the underground tuber. They can also form stolons that are attached to the main plant but form a growth several inches away, or basal growths that occur after flowering around the base of the flowering growth.", ,"The World Checklist of Monocotyledons currently recognizes 171 species and 4 natural hybrids.

The genus Dockrillia was created by Brieger in 1981 to accommodate the fleshy-leaved species previously contained in Dendrobium Sect. Rhizobium, commonly known as ""pencil orchids"". The name Dockrillia commemorates Alick Dockrill, the eminent Australian orchidologist and author.

These orchids are sympodial epiphytes, mostly pendulous in habit, with wiry rhizomes, no pseudobulbs, and fleshy, succulent leaves, often circular in cross-section. The non-resupinate flowers are carried on inflorescences which arise from nodes on the rhizome near the leaf bases. In some species the flowers are solitary, while in others the racemes carry up to a dozen blooms.

The most commonly cultivated species include D. teretifolia, D. fairfaxii, D. linguiformis, D. cucumerina, and D. striolata, D. pugioniformis, which are all cool-growing orchids. D. rigida and D. calamiformis, from tropical Australia, require intermediate conditions. Two species from Papua New Guinea, D. fuliginosa and D. convoluta (known respectively for years as Dendrobium teretifolium 'Black Pam' and 'Firey Glow""' are also seen in collections.
Most species are hardy plants in cultivation.

Dainty and delicate are two very descriptive terms to aptly portray Domingoa species. These miniatures are very pleasing and, when well established, are in flower most of the year with “rather oddly attractive flowers” (Hawkes 1965). This small genus was established in 1913 and named for Santo Domingo, now the Dominican Republic, where the type species was found. The genus is closely allied to Epidendrum but differs in floral characteristics, especially the lip, which is free and entire.

The elongate pseudobulbs of these sympodial epiphytes are tightly clustered on the short, creeping rhizome. Each narrow pseudobulb is ensheathed by papery bracts and topped by one fleshy, almost linear leaf up to 1-1/2 inches ( 4 cm) long and 0.25 inch ((0.5 cm) wide. The slender terminal inflorescences are also ensheathed by tan papery bracts and bear several flowers. Because buds open one at a time, the plant is in flower over a long period of time. 

The I-inch wide flowers in this genus are very similar. The base color is creamy yellow with red-purple marks. Two species in this genus are Domingoa haematochila (synonym hymenodes) and D. nodosa. ", ,The World Monocot Checklist currently recognizes 2 species and 1 natural hybrid. (8/2007)

Subtribe: Sarcanthinae

Doritis is a genus of small to medium-sized, predominantly terrestrial plants native to southeast Asia. With the publication of Genera Orchidacearum volume 6, all Doritis species are now included in the genus Phalaenopsis . The showy, medium-sized flowers are produced on stiffly erect inflorescences, an adaptation resulting from their terrestrial habitat. The name Doritis is derived either from the Greek dory, spear – an allusion to the lip shape or from Doritis, a name given to the goddess Aphrodite. Doritis usually bloom during the summer and are characterized by a dark, cerise color, which is shared with many of its hybrid progeny (the bright red lip of many hybrid Doritaenopsis is believed to be inherited from the Doritis background as well). The most commonly grown species of this is D. pulcherrima.

Very closely related to Phalaenopsis, Doritis is a genus of small to medium-sized, predominantly terrestrial plants native to southeast Asia. The showy, medium-sized flowers are strongly allied to Phalaenopsis and freely interbreed creating thousands of registered Doritaenopsis hybrids. These intergeneric hybrids commonly behave more like their Phalaenopsis ancestors and should be treated or grown as such. Christenson, in his Phalaenopsis Monograph sinks Doritis, as section Esmeralda, into synonymy with Phalaenopsis and the Kew World Monocot Checklist has accepted this taxonomic revision. While hybrids continue to be registered as Doritaenopsis, this may change in the near future if the RHS Registrar also accepts the revision. The name Doritis is derived either from the Greek dory, spear – an allusion to the lip shape or from Doritis, a name given to the goddess Aphrodite. While many Phalaenopsis inflorescences tend to gracefully arch, those of Doritis are stiffly erect, an adaptation resulting from their terrestrial habitat. Doritis also bloom during the summer and are characterized by a dark, cerise color, which is shared with many of its hybrid progeny (the bright red lip of many hybrid Doritaenopsis is believed to be inherited from the Doritis background as well).

Dracula,Luer 1978,"DRA-cu-la (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Epidendreae
Subtribe: Pleurothallidinae

These small to medium sized epiphytes have very unusual, somewhat other-worldly flowers, at least in the eyes of Carlyle Luer who established the genus in 1978 and named it after the Latin word for dragon. Prior to this time, the intriguing species of this genus were included in Masdevallia. Today approximately 90 species that are found in moist forests, mostly in western Colombia and Ecuador, are recognized. Dracula have short, creeping rhizomes with short, erect, one-leafed, thin textured shoots with a distinct midrib. The colorful, typically single flowers are usually large and pendent, although some species exhibit erect inflorescences. Individual flowers are usually produced singly in succession and in some species, inflorescences are capable of producing 5, 6 or more flowers during the lifetime of the inflorescence.

The tips of the sepals form long, slender tails. At the uppermost part, the short petals have a warty texture which can give the appearance of two eyes along either side of the nose-like column. Draculas are very popular in hobbyist collections and many species and hybrids are now in cultivation. Whether due to the interesting flowers or to the fanciful names, D. vampira, D. chimaera, D. bella, D. gorgona and D. simia are some of the sought-after species.

Tribe: Cymdibieae
Subtribe: Catasetinae

In 1975, C. H. Dodson published his revision of the genus Catasetum in which he removed from that genus the eight species that bore bisexual or perfect flowers. He resurrected the genus Clowesia with C. rosea as its type from the original description and transferred four other species from Catasetum to Clowesia. The remaining three species with perfect or bisexual flowers, dilectum, eburneum and suavis, were placed in the newly established genus Dressleria. The new genus was named for scientist and taxonomist Dr Robert Dressler. Dressleria is a genus of epiphytic plants growing in wet montane forests ranging from 400 to 1500 meters above sea level. Unlike all the other Catasetinae, Dressleria must never be allowed to dry out. They do not have a rest period like the other members of the subtribe and they do not lose their leaves each year. The leaves on backbulbs of Dressleria may last as many as three years. This is the most important key to growing Dressleria. If you try to grow them like Catasetum, they will decline and eventually die. The inflorescences of Dressleria emerge from the base of the pseudobulb usually together with the emergence of the new growth. In contrast to Catasetum with smoothly arched pendent inflorescences from the base of the pseudobulb and Clowesia with sharply pendent inflorescences from the base of the pseudobulb, the inflorescences of Dressleria are thick and erect when they emerge from the base of the pseudobulb. So far no hybrids have been registered with Dressleria. The most common species in cultivation is Dressleria dilecta, but D. eburnea, and D. helleri can sometimes be found from specialist growers. One of the original species that Dodson moved to Dressleria, D. suavis, is now considered to be a synonym of D. eburnea. All Dressleria species bear non-resupinate flowers of very heavy substance.

Carlyle Luer established the genus Dryadella in 1978,naming it for the mythological Dryads. Prior to this time, all of the approximately 40 species of this genus had been included in Masdevallia. D. simula, the type species, was described by H.G. Reichenbach in 1875 who called it “a troglodyte among Masdevallia” because of the way its flowers are hidden between the leaves. The plants are small in size, the flowers successive but buried deep down in the foliage. The genus is found in specialist collections, never having become popular in the mainstream because of these characteristics. Other species in this genus include D. lilliputana, D. aviceps, D. edwallii and D. guatemalensis.
