Palumbina,Reichenbach f. 1863,"pal-um-BEE-nuh (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Maxillarieae 
Subtribe: Oncidiinae


At first glance the crosslike flowers of Palumbina do not look like an orchid. Only four flower segments are visible as the two lateral sepals are fused and hidden behind the lip. The single species was first found in Guatemala by Hartweg in 1840 and named Oncidium candidum by Lindley in 1843. In 1863, Reichenbach f. noted that this species was the only one in the genus Oncidium with fused lateral sepals. This difference he felt was sufficient to warrant placing it in its own monotypic genus, which he named Palumbina. Recently, this single species has been transferred, based on genetic data to Cuitlauzina. 

The reason for his Reichenbach f.’s choice of name is unclear. The Greek word palumbina means “belong to a dove”. According to The Manual of Cultivated Orchid Species, it is “probably in reference to the white flowers, while being a color associated with doves”; while Shultes and Pease feel it is “alluding to a fanciful resemblance of the flowers to a bird with outspread wings”. No matter the meaning of the name, Palumbina produces delightful, dainty, pristine white flowers.

Vegetatively, there is little variation among plants. The ovoid, loosely clustered, somewhat flattened pseudobulbs, up to 1-1/2 inches (3.75 cm) tall, consist of one node and are topped by a solitary leaf. Each pseudobulb has a basal sheath. The linear to almost lanceolate leaves are up to 12 inches (30 cm) long and ½ inch (1.25 cm) wide.

The erect to slightly arched few (usually two to four) flowered inflorescences arise from the base of the newly developed growth. Individual flowers are up to an inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. The flowers are white, and there are reports of flowers with a few purple dots at the bases of the floral segments. The callus is yellow and may have from one to a few purple dots.

Palumbina flowers vary little in appearance. The sepals and petals are elliptical to almost round and are alike in color. The petals are more rounded and slightly larger than the sepals. The two lateral sepals are fused, have a bifed apex and are hidden beneath the lip. The nonlobed lip is the largest floral segment and has a distinct basal callus. The one species in this genus, Palumbina candida (synonymous with Cuitlauzina) can be found in cultivation.","According to the WCSP, this monotypic genus, consisting of one species, Palumbina candida, has been transferred to Cuitlauzina candida.","Southern Mexico, Guatemala"
Paphinia,Lindley 1843,"pah-FINN-ee-ah (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Maxillarieae 
Subtribe: Stanhopeinae


Paphinia is a tropical genus of epiphytic plants that produce fairly to exceptionally showy flowers, and most species are typically from the Amazon. It was described by John Lindley. Although there are two species that are typically from the Brazilian Amazon lowlands, Paphinia cristata and P. grandiflora, most other species are found on the slopes of the Amazon Andes mountains (Guyana, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru) at higher altitudes but not too high (to about 3,000 ft. – 900 m. or so). Paphinia cristata is the most widespread species in the genus, occurring all over the Amazon and even on the island of Trinidad, north of Venezuela. Its flowers are fairly showy, and at 3” to 4” across are among the smallest in the genus (flowers of Paphinia herrerae can be about 7-8” across). They are very colorful, pinkish but heavily overlaid with dark red bars and stripes and the lip has a group of long white hairs at the top. The other species have fairly similar color patterns, but are usually not as brighly colored. Paphinias have pendent inflorescences that can be single-flowered (Paphinia grandiflora) or multi-flowered (P. herrerae), and the flowers are usually short-lived.",The World Monocot Checklist currently recognizes 16 species and 6 varieties.

Tribe: Cypripedieae 
Subtribe:


The generic name Paphiopedilum was derived from the Greek Paphos (a city with a temple dedicated to Venus) and pedilon (sandal). As cypripediums, phragmipediums and selenipediums are popularly known as ‘lady’s slippers’, so too are paphs since they are all characterized by a slipper-shaped lip. Rather than growing from a pseudobulb, these mostly terrestrial, sympodial plants instead form fans of six or more leaves. The flowers of some species present warts and hairs, fascinating traits for lovers of this genus. Depending on the species, the flowers are borne either singularly or in multiples. Ernst Pfitzer separated the 60-65 known species from Cypripedium in 1886. The genus has been further divided into subgenera which form more or less natural groupings. These subgenera include: Parvisepalum, Brachypetalum, Polyantha, Sigmatopetalum and Cochlopetalum. 

Due to their ease in adapting to cultivation, paphs are common in hobbyist collections, far more so than cyps or phrags. Many artificial hybrids have been made with paphiopedilums and the number of awards is history. Unlike other popular orchid genera, ways to meristem Paphiopedilum have yet to be found and all plants are either collected or grown from seed. Artificially created species are always better in shape and ease of cultivation due to line breeding. Buying collected plants is not recommended – and could land you in jail! Species popular in collections include: P. armeniacum,, P. barbatum, P. callosum, P. charlesworthii, P. concolor, P. delenatii, P. farrieanum, P. lowii, P. malipoensis, P. micranthum, P. rothschildianum, P. sanderianum P. sukhakulii and a long etc. ","The World Monocot Checklist currently recognizes over 100 species, including numerous varietal forms and 23 natural hybrids.

Papilionanthe,Schlechter 1915,"pah-pill-ee-oh-NAN-thee (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Vandeae 
Subtribe: Aeridinae


The genus Papilionanthe was first described by Schlechter in 1915 when he moved Vanda teres into Papilionanthe, as a monotypic genus because he felt  V. teres was intermediate between Vanda and Aerides. He derived the generic name from the Latin papilio (butterfly) and anthe (flower) to describe the colorful butterflylike flowers of this plant.

Unfortunately, most taxonomists ignored Schlechter’s classification until 1972 when Garay clarified the lack of understanding of Schlechter’s work. Garay added new taxonomic changes so the genus would include a section of Aerides and now there are 11 species in this once monotypic genus. 

Papilionanthe is probably best known for its primary hybrid Papilionanthe Miss Joaquim (teres x hookeriana), the major lei flower of Hawaii and also the national flower of Singapore, and as a full-sun garden flower throughout tropical and subtropical countries.

Vegetatively, these monopodial epiphytic or terrestrial species of Papilionanthe are similar. They are characterized by their thin stems with alternate terete leaves. These leaves, either straight or recurved, are up to 8 inches (20 cm) long and their leaf bases clasp the stem. Aerial roots arise from the nodes and are usually at right angles from the leaves. The short inflorescence also arises from a node but is opposite the leaf. It can be up to 12 inches (30 cm) long and bear from a few to twenty flowers, which may be small or up to 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter (P. teres). The base flower colors are lavender and white. Papilionanthe flowers are attractive and showy. Species in cultivation include P. hookeriana, P. teres, P. tricuspidata, and P. vandarum.",The WCSP currently recognizes 10 species.

Tribe: Maxillarieae 
Subtribe: Oncidiinae


Plants of this winsome miniature monotypic genus, Papperitzia, with their quaint, pale green flowers, have always been considered rare by most orchidophiles. Rare not only because they are found only in a limited area of southern Mexico, but also because they are twig epiphytes and are apparently short lived, usually not more than five to six years under greenhouse conditions. They may become less rare in cultivation as orchid nurseries are propagating Papperitzia from seed. The genus was first described by Reichenbach f. in 1852, who named it for his friend William Papperitz.

Vegetatively, these miniature sympodial epiphytes form small clusters of pseudobulbs on young twigs. Each miniscule pseudobulb (up to ¼ inch [0.6 cm] tall) is topped by a single leaf and subtended by usually three loosely clasping leaves. The linear sharp-tipped leaves, to 2-1/2 inches (7 cm) long, are stiff and leathery. The inflorescence, either arched or erect, arises from the base of the pseudobulb and usually has up to five or six flowers. The small pale green flowers, about ½ inch (1.25 cm) across, open sequentially from the base of the inflorescence.

Tribe: Vandeae 
Subtribe: Aeridinae


In 1963 Alex Hawkes separated the genus Paraphalaenopsis from Phalaenopsis. He believed the long terete leaves, along with other differences in floral characteristics, were sufficient evidence to establish this new genus. Because of the close affinity between the two genera, Hawkes chose the name Paraphalaenopsis, derived from the Greek para (near) and Phalaenopsis, the genus from which it was separated.

The distinguishing feature of this small genus is the terete, cylindrical leaves which lead to the genus becoming popularly known as the ‘rat-tailed’ phalaenopsis. The type species of the genus is Paraphalaenopsis denevei which flowers freely, blooming several times a year. The flowers of the genus are showy and long lasting, faintly scented, usually 5 to 7 on a raceme, although some species (P. laycockii), can produce 15 flowers on a single inflorescense. Species found in cultivation include P. labukensis, P. laycockii and P. serpentilingua. More commonly found are the hybrids made in recent years such as P. Kimmy (labukensis x denevei). Intergeneric hybrids are also being created and include man-made genera such as Paracentrum (Asctm x Pps), Paravandrum (Asctm x Pps x Vanda.), and Pararenanthera (Pps x Renanthera).",Currently the WCSP  recognizes 4 species and one natural hybrid.

Tribe: Maxillarieae 
Subtribe: Stanhopeinae


The Holy Ghost or Dove Orchid (Peristeria elata) is the most widely known member of this small genus. The first plants of Peristeria were sent to England in 1826 and were flowered in 1831. William J. Hooker, when describing the genus, named it Peristeria after the Greek word meaning dove, due to the likeness of a dove that appears in the flowers. Peristeria elata is the national flower of Panama.

This group of sympodial, terrestrial or epiphytic orchids has large, almost-teardrop-shaped pseudobulbs. Four or five massive pleated leaves arise from the apex of each pseudobulb. The inflorescence arising from the base of the pseudobulb may be pendulous or erect and from 6 inches (15 cm) to 4 feet (120 cm) long, bearing 4 to 20 flowers. The base color of the flowers is white or yellowish with some pink or red spots.Other species in this genus include Peristeria rossiana (synonym P. aspersa), P. cerina and P. pendula.",The WCSP recognizes 12 species. (2/2020),The American Tropics from Costa Rica and Panama south to Peru and Brazil
Phaius,Loureiro 1790,"FAY-us (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Arethuseae 
Subtribe: Bletiinae


Phaius tankervilleae was introduced into England in 1778 by John Fothergill, who brought the plant from China. The genus was identified by Juan Loureiro, who also named it using the Greek word phaios (swarthy), probably because of the yellow–brown flower color that dominates the genus. Phaius tankervilleae is commonly called the nun’s orchid, possibly due to the lateral view of the column, which resembles a Madonna.

The genus contains around 50 pseudobulbous, sympodial, robust species with very short rhizomes. There are both terrestrial and epiphytic species, with the terrestrials most widely known.

The thickened, stocky pseudobulbs are hidden by the ensheathing leaf bases. Each pseudobulb is enclosed by 2 to 8 large, thin, deeply grooved leaves, up to 4 feet (120 cm) long and 10 inches (25 cm) wide. Many flowers are borne on the 3 to 4 foot (90 -120 cm) tall inflorescences. The 4 inch (10 cm) wide flowers are very showy and distinctive.

Several different species native to Madagascar are encountered in the trade under the name Phaius. While very closely related, there are sufficient differences between these species and true Phaius to warrant their segregation under a distinct genus. These eight species are now known as Gastrorchis (for instance G. pulchra). 

Phaius and the related Gastrorchis can be propagated in an unusual way. Once the flowers are spent, the flower stem can be cut above the base and just below where the first flower was attached. The remaining section is from 1 to several feet (30+ cm) long. Below each bract on the stem is a bud capable of producing a new plant. The stems are laid horizontally in a flat of moist sphagnum moss. Both ends are covered with moss to prevent drying out. The flat containing many stems is then placed under the bench and kept moist. As soon as the young plants have 2 or 3 roots, they can be snapped off the parent stem and placed in individual pots. Plantlets will require 2 to 3 years to attain flowering size.","The WCSP currently recognizes 43 species, 2 subspecies and 13 varieties. (2/2020)","India, Bhutan, Burma, Thailand, S.

Tribe: Vandeae 
Subtribe: Sarcanthinae


Commonly known as ‘moth orchids’ the very name Phalaenopsis is derived from the Greek words phalaina, moth; and opsis, appearance. Plants in this genus are monopodial and usually epiphytic, although there are ocassional lithophytes and those species formerly included in Doritis are typically terrestrial in their native habitat. There are 63 species, 7 natural hybrids and numerous recognized varietal forms in the genus. Phalaenopsis are among the most popular cultivated orchids and thousands of hybrids have been made throughout the years. The plants, themselves are attractive, with succulent leaves and some species exhibit sweet fragrance. Inflorescences range from short with few flowers to very branched floriferous stems. Flowers are generally long lasting, making Phalaenopsis the most popular of orchid pot plants. According to Christenson, there are five subgenera: Proboscidioides which includes Phal. lowii; Aphyllae which includes Phal. hainanensis, stobartiana, and braceana; Parishianae which includes Phal. appendiculata, gibbosa and parishii; Polychilos which includes many species used in today’s modern hybrids such as Phal. mannii, fuscata, amboinensis, bellina, violacea, fasciata, gigantea, hieroglyphica and cornu-cervi; and Phalaenopsis which includes some of the most popular and well-known species such as Phal. amabilis, aphrodite, equestris, schilleriana and stuartiana. They are found in three different habitats; the species in subgenus Polychilos and subgenus Phalaenopsis come from warm and humid habitats, however, those in subgenus Aphyllae and Parishianea are from higher elevations and cooler temperatures and they should not be grown together with the other types or with the common hybrids as their requirements are remarkably different.

Similar in many ways to the other slipper orchids, the paphiopedilums, selenipediums and cypripediums Phragmipedium is a very popular genus that was established by Robert Rolfe in 1896 when he revised all the slipper orchids. Those species native to the tropical Americas were placed in either Selenipedium or Phragmipedium. Rolfe named the genus, using the Greek words phragma (fence) in reference to the division of the ovary and pedilon (slipper). As with the other slipper orchids, the species of this genus are sympodial in growth habit and form tight fans instead of pseudobulbs. All species are either epiphytic or terrestrial and grow at elevations between 1300-7200 feet (400 to 2,200 meters). Inflorescences can be up to 3 ft. (90 cm) long and can bear up to 15 flowers. The flowers themselves can measure 30 inches (75 cm) or more from the tip of the dorsal sepal to the tip of a lateral petal. The flowers, once thought to consist mainly of yellows, greens and browns, some with yellow and purplish patterns, now include orange, red (P. besseae) and even magenta (P. kovachii).

The genus was first described by Schlechter in 1910. The name derives from platys = broad and stele = column in reference to the broad, flat column characteristic of the genus. Platystele species have mostly tufted, short-stemmed leaves and are found in the moist, neotropical forests most commonly at moderately high altitudes 1,500 m (4,900 feet) to 2,500 m (8,200 feet) where other genera of the Pleurothallidinae are also abundant.

Pleiones bear large showy flowers that are almost oversized for these miniature plants. Unlike most other pseudobulbous orchids, Pleione has annual pseudobulbs. These easy to grow plants are referred to as “windowsill plants” in England, where they are used as houseplants. The genus was first described by David Don in 1825 based on specimens of Pleione praecox and Pleione humilis, both of which had originally been called Epidendrum by Smith. They were later transferred to Coelogyne by Lindley and in 1903 Rolfe resurrected the name Pleione. Don dedicated the genus to Pleione, the mother of Pleiades. 

Vegetatively, these sympodial terrestrial orchids are similar. They vary namely in the number of leaves and the shape and color of the pseudobulbs. The spring-flowering species (e.g., P. formosana) have one leaf while the autumn flowering species (e.g., P. praecox and P. scopulorum) have two leaves. The small pseudobulbs are ovoid to conical in shape and may be green to reddish brown. Sheaths surmounting the new growths may be green or mottled red. They are sometimes inflated (P. maculata). The lanceolate or oblanceolate leaves (up to 10 inches [25 cm] long) are borne at the apex of the new pseudobulb and have a sharp tip. The one-or two-flowered inflorescence develops at the apex of the new growth, either just as the growth is developing in the spring (P. formosana) or as the leaves turn brown in the autumn (P. praecox). The color of these 3 inch (7.5 cm) flowers is lavender-magenta, although white and yellow are also found.

The flowers are similar among the species. Sepals and petals are alike in shape and color, with the sepals a little broader. The lip is the largest and showiest floral segment and is often three lobed. There is a distinct callus on the lip which helps in identifying species. The margin of the lip may be entire or fringed. The column is long and narrow, widening near the stigmatic surface and anther cap. The apex is slightly hooded. There are four yellow pollinia, in two pairs, attached to an interesting caudicle.

Tribe: Epidendreae 
Subtribe: Pleurothallidinae


Pleurothallis is a conglomerate genus, a taxonomists dream (or perhaps nightmare) and in a constant state of flux. There is no simple description of Pleurothallis, as it is a huge genus comprising species from miniscule to very large in size, epiphytic to terrestrial, clumping to creeping in growth, thick or thin leaved, erect to pendent. The flowers can be delicate or thickly textured; racemes can be single flowered or many flowered, short to very long. At present, over 1,000 species have been described, classified into 27 subgenera with 25 sections (Luer). Recent genetic work suggests that Pleurothallis should be divided into approximately 17 different genera while Luer has recently suggested the creation of 49 segregates.

Pleurothallis species are found throughout the American tropics. It is easy to find trees with 5, 6, 7 or more different species on one branch! There are some species for just about any growing condition, from the warm to intermediate to cool greenhouse; from wet to dry growing areas. The one thing that brings these diverse plants together is flower size. Most Pleurothallis flowers are so small that a magnifying glass is often needed to appreciate their beauty and complexity. As with any small flowered species, it is a specimen-sized plant in full bloom that catches the eye and forces appreciation from even a die-hard Cattleya lover!

Pleurothallis was first described by Robert Brown in 1813. He named the genus from the Greeek pleuron (rib) and thallos (short, branch) in allusion to the many rib-like stems which arise in tufts in many of the species. Pleurothallis is allied to Masdevallia but the flowers are much smaller and lack the characteristic sepaline tube of Masdevallia. 

A favorite of the specialist hobbyist, some of the Pleurothallis species found in collections include: P. allenii, P. endotrachys, P. grobyi, P. glandulosa (now all three considered members of Specklinia), and P. octomerioides (now considered to by Myoxanthus octomerioides).

The generic name tells it all. Derived from the Greek words polys (many) kyknos (swan), Polycycnis is a very descriptive name to describe the many delicate, swan-like flowers that grace the mostly pendulous inflorescences. Florally, these attractive species resemble Cycnoches species but differ in having hermaphroditic flowers. Vegetatively, these species ,more closely resemble Gongora species, but again there are differences in the flowers. The genus was first described by Reichenbach in 1855 who based his decision and established a new genus on the distinctive floral characteristics of this group. He also picked a very descriptive generic name that readily recognized these distinctive birdlike flowers. Vegetatively, the sympodial epiphytes of this genus are similar. The closely grouped pseudobulbs range from ovoid to almost cylindric in shape and can be up to 6 inches (15 cm) in height. Each pseudobulb is topped by a single leaf, or occasionally two leaves. The leaves have blades up to 16 inches (40 cm) long and 5 inches (12.5 cm) wide and have longitudinal folds. The few- to many-flowered inflorescences arise from the base of the pseudobulb. Most floral stems are pendulous and may be up to 24 inches (60 cm) long. The base flower color ranges from pale yellow to buff, and flowers are heavily spotted with reddish to brownish dots. Species included in this genus are: Polycycnis aurita, P. barbata, P. gratiosa, P. lehmannii, P. mucifera (type species) and P. surinamensis (synonym P. ornata).",The WCSP currently recognizes 14 species. (2/2020),"From Panama to Costa Rica to Colombia, Guyana and Peru"

From the Greek meaning ""far, far off"" and ""tongue"", the name refers to the position of the lip, which is very distinctive in this genus. The utterly fascinating lip is hinged and has a mechanism that snaps shut when stimulated by a pollinator, thus trapping the insect to ensure that the pollinia will be removed and later transferred to the receptive surface. The lip opens after 30 minutes or so to release the insect, but also closes at night and reopens at dawn. Porroglossums have successively flowered inflorescences with petals that are small and fleshy. The plants are easy to cultivate and with their successively flowering habit are almost always in full bloom.

This is the newly resurrected genus name for the group of orchids that have been classified in the past with epidendrums, encyclias, anacheiliums and many others. This group has always been problematic in that the physical characteristics seem not to fit into nice discrete groups allowing easy classification. In 1997, Higgins placed many plants into this genus. This group of plants has a rhizome with pseudobulbs that are at least somewhat flattened. The inflorescence has a spathe at the base. The lip is attached or adnate to the column only part way and the column has three teeth at the apex. The seed capsule is three-angled or three-winged. Generally speaking, this group consists of two groups of plants. The first group is the cockleshell group, known for the non-resupinate (flowers up side down, lip uppermost.) such as Prosthechea (synonym Encyclia) cochleata. The second group includes the Mexican and Central American types such as Prosthechea (synonym Encyclia) prismatocarpa with the same plant type but resupinate flowers and bright colors.

These plants are generally very fragrant and the flowers last a long time, sometimes months. They bloom usually once a year but as the flowers last so long they seem in bloom a lot.

The pseudobulbs are tightly clustered, oval, oblong and almost round, very compressed, wrinkled, often dull red. The leaves are solitary and erect. Inflorescences are normally solitary per bulb, jointed and arched, arising from the base out of a sheath, producing a succession of flowers which last approx. 10 days, variable in color and size from inflorescence to inflorescence and from blooming to blooming. Never cut the inflorescence until it is obviously spent as old inflorescences will continue to produce flowers for many years.

The narrow, upright attenuated dorsal sepal and petals are dull to vibrant red-brown often with a narow yellow picotee or with a few yellow transverse stripes. The broad, often downswept lateral sepals are canary yellow heavily marked with irregular transverse red-brown bars. The large lip is three-lobed with a large canary yellow center, bordered by a red-brown band. In addition to the normally pigmented forms, pure yellow forms devoid of the red pigment also exist. Flowering occurs at intervals throughout the entire year and well grown plants will have many inflorescences with more than one flower per inflorescence.

In their native habitat Psychopsis prefer the trunks and branches of trees where they dry out quickly although they do not like to dry out completely and do not require a rest period. Psychopsis are intolerant of stale conditions at their roots and benefit from annual repotting, especially in bark mixes. The roots of these plants are fine and subject to salt burn if the potting medium is not regularly flushed with pure water. Because of their fat pseudobulbs, cultural problems can go undetected until significant damage has been done.","Currently the WCSP recognizes 4 species: Psychopsis: papilio, krameriana, sanderae versteegii.","Trinidad, Central & South America"

Subtribe: Pterostylidinae

‘Greenhoods’, as they are popularly known in Australia and New Zealand, are small to medium sized terrestrials with subterranean tubers. Pterostylis flowers are characteristically hooded and the sensitive to the touch labellum is hinged. The genus is the largest of the Australasian terrestrials and some of the species can be difficult to distinguish. Some Pterostylis species grow in colonies while others grow individually or in scattered groups. The species that are colonial in nature are generally easily cultivated, forming specimen sized plants when provided with adequate growing conditions. The erect inflorescences usually have one to a few flowers. Due to the prominent columnar wings found in all species of the genus, Robert Brown, in 1810, used the Greek words pteron (wing) and stylis (column) in coining the generic name. Though not terribly showy when in flower, this genus is frequently found in collections in its areas of distribution. Species include: P. cucullata, P. grandiflora and P. plumose.

One of the keys to successful culture of these terrestrial orchids is recognizing their sharply deciduous nature. After growth is complete and flowering is past, the plants rapidly shed their foliage and rest dormant for months. They must not be watered during this dormant period.",The World Monocot Checklist currently recognizes more than 150 species.
