Galeandra,Lindley 1830,"gal-ee-AN-dra (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Cymbidieae 
Subtribe: Cyrtopodiinae


John Lindley proposed this genus in 1830. The generic epithet means helmet shaped and refers to the shape of the anther cap. The type species is G. baueri. The genus is characterized by the elongate, cylindrical or spindle-shaped pseudobulbs and thin, narrow, heavily veined, distichous leaves at the nodes. The inflorescences are produced from the top of the pseudobulbs and are few to many-flowered. Most of the species have very showy flowers with tubular lips. In most species, plants occur as epiphytes at low elevations between sea level to 500 meters. A few occur at higher elevations as terrestrials. Most commonly known are G. baueri, G. batemanii, and G. devoniana.",The World Monocot Checklist contains 18 accepted names.

Gastrochilus,D. Don 1825,"gas-troh-KYE-luss (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Vandeae 
Subtribe: Aeridinae


This very delightful group of mostly dwarf, monopodial epiphytes was assembled into the genus Gastrochilus by David Don in the early 1800’s. The generic name, a combination of the Greek words gaster (stomach, belly) and cheilos (lip), refers to the unusual lips. 

Vegetatively, Gastrochilus species resemble small Phalaenopsis species with longer, narrower leaves. The thick, leatherly, fairly stiff leaves are almost lance-shaped and up to 7 inches (17.5 cm) long. The very short stems usually bear six to ten closely spaced leaves. One or more inflorescences arise from the axil of the lower leaves. The short, densely flowered inflorescence has a few to 20 flowers and may be erect or pendent. The color of the flowers ranges from a clear yellow (Gastrochilus dasypogon) to blotched with large brownish-purple spots (G. bellinus). Other species in this genus include G. calceolaris, G, formosanus, G. acutifolius, G. japonicus and others",The World Monocot Checklist currently recognizes 52 species.

Gastrorchis,Thouars 1809,"Gast-ROAR-kiss (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Arethuseae 
Subtribe: Bletinae


Gastrorchis (also spelled Gastorchis) is a genus of 8 species endemic (found only in) to Madagascar. The species in this genus are superficially rather similar to those of Phaius and at times have been classified as Phaius species. The plants differ from those of true Phaius in their overall smaller and less robust stature and very different floral structure. The name Gastrorchis was first used by Thouars in 1809 and is derived from the two Greek words gaster (stomach or belly) and orchis (orchid) in reference to the sack-like lip base. 

All 8 species are essentially terrestrial plants and respond well in any well-drained moisture retentive medium. The plants produce small clustered pseudobulbs typically about 1-2cm in diameter and up to about 3cm tall. The evergreen ribbed leaves, 1-4 or 5 depending on the species, are typically a bright, glossy moderate green and are produced from the top of the pseudobulb. Individual leaves consist of a 15-25cm petiolate base and a leaf blade ranging from 15-30cm long and 8-10cm wide. The inflorescences, produced from the developing new growth, are erect and carry from 4 to 12 flowers depending on the species. The comparitively large, 2-2 ½ inch (5-6cm), richly colored flowers are strikingly beautiful and are produced in succession over a period of 3-5 weeks making them rewarding specimens. 

These species are very closely related to Phaius and Calanthe and several intergeneric hybrids have been registered. These include: Gastrophaius Dan Rosenberg (sold in the trade as Phaius Dan Rosenberg) = Gastrorchis tuberculosa x Phaius tankervilleae, and Gastrocalanthe Berryana = Calanthe masuca x Gastrorchis humblotii. 

The 8 currently recognized species are: Gastrorchis francoisii, G. geffrayi, G. humblotii, G. lutea, G. peyrotii, G. pulchra, G. simulans, and G. tuberculosa. ",The World Monocot Checklist currently recognizes 8 species and several named varietal forms (8/2007),Madagascar
Gomesa,R. Brown 1815,"go-MEZ-ah (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Epidendroideae 
Subtribe: Oncidiinae


Gomesa is a Brazilian tropical genus that was described by Robert Brown and named after Dr. Bernardino Antonio Gomes, a Portuguese physician and botanist. There may be several more species than the dozen currently recognized, but these names so far have not been clarified. These plants grow in mountainous coastal tropical rain forest at altitudes from 1,500 to 4,000 ft. (450 to 1,300m.) in the states of Rio Grande do Sul to Espírito Santo. A few species find their way a bit more into the interior but always in humid forests around rivers. In the natural habitat, plants are epiphytic or lithophytic, usually with a lot of organic material trapped on the sheaths of the pseudobulbs. Plants of Gomesa produce fairly well-developed pseudobulbs, and the whole plants are more of a light dull green color than typical Oncidium types. Inflorescences are arched and produce numerous small (to 1”) flowers where the dorsal sepal and petals stand up and lateral sepals point down, producing very peculiarly shaped flowers. Flowers are uniformly greenish-yellow to green, regardless of the species so it is sometimes quite difficult to set them apart. The flowers are usually strongly fragrant. The most common species in cultivation are Gomesa recurva and G. crispa, although a few others sometimes find their way into cultivation",The World Monocot Checklist currently recognizes 13 species.

Gongora,Ruiz & Pavon 1794,"gon-GOR-a (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Maxillarieae
Subtribe: Stanhopeinae


Gongora is an epiphytic genus of sympodial orchids that are usually found between 0 and 1000m in wet tropical forests. Pseudobulbs are ovoid, strongly ridged, with two-three plicate leaves. The pendulous inflorescences arise from the base of the pseudobulbs, are more than a meter long in some species, and bear many intricately-shaped, flowers. that are often scented. In general, gongoras are easy to grow into large and showy plants.This genus was named for Sr. Don Antonio Caballero y Gongora, Viceroy of New Granada (Colombia and Ecuador) and later Bishop of Cordoba; Governor of Peru during the Dombey, Ruiz & Pavon expeditions. The type species is Gongora quinquenervis, described by H. Ruiz & J. Pavon in 1794 in their Prodromus Florae Peruvianae et Chilensis. Commonly grown species include Gongora armeniaca; Gga. galeata; Gga. quinquenervis (maculata)","The World Monocot Checklist recognizes 74 species, subspecies, and varieties (7/2009)",Tropical America

Tribe: Cymbidieae
Subtribe: Cyrtopodiinae



Carl Blume established this genus of sympodial orchids in 1825. The generic epithet is from the Greek gramma = letter and phyllon = leaf and refers to the conspicuous markings on the floral segments. Type species for this genus is the very large Grammatophyllum speciosum. There are two distinct growth forms in this genus: one with long spindle-like pseudobulbs reaching several metres in length; the others with distinct ovate pseudobulbs. Commonly seen species are Grammatophyllum scriptum and Grammatophyllum stapeliiflorum. All are very showy species.",The World Checklist of Monocotyledons recognizes 13 names (7/2009),"South East Asia, New Guinea and some of the islands of the Pacific Ocean."
Grobya,Lindley 1835,"GRO-be-ah (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Cymbidieae 
Subtribe: Cyrtopodiinae


Grobya was described by John Lindley and is a genus with very few species, the two better known being G. amherstiae and G. galeata. A third species, Grobya fascifera, is very similar to G. galeata. Both these species occur at about 2,500 to 4,500 ft (800 to 1,400 m) elevation on the Brazilian coastal mountain range knows as “Serra do Mar”, the coastal range that runs parallel to and near the coast from the states of Rio Grande do Sul to Espírito Santo, and on the second parallel mountain range to the interior, called “Serra da Mantiqueira”. The two species are very similar in growth habit, and both inhabit the tropical rain forest where humidity is high and fairly constant and conditions are shady. They also have in common pendent inflorescences and flowers that have a “hood” formed from the dorsal sepal and petals. Grobya amherstiae carries up to 20 or more spotted flowers on a greenish-yellow background and that are over an inch in diameter and smell like honey. These flowers are produced on a foot-long inflorescence. Grobya galeata is similar, but inflorescences are longer and produce more than twice the number of flowers; these however, are about half as large. The genus was named in honor of Lord Grey of Groby, England, an avid orchid grower and patron of horticulture.",The World Monocot Checklist currently recognizes 5 species (2 well-known in cultivation).
