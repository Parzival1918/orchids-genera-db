The generic epithet honours Oberon - King of the Fairies, lives in hiding; in reference to the insignificant flowers. Type species for this genus is Oberonia iridifolia. The plants are generally quite attractive with their iris-like growth habit. The flowers in the majority of the species are minute and can only be appreciated through a high-powered magnifying glass. Any species in cultivation from this genus would only be found in specialist collections.",

The lips are lobed with a hinged base.\n\r\nTo learn more, join The Pleurothallid Alliance, an AOS affiliated specialty group www.pleurothallids.com",

They are epiphytes or terrestrials with anchoring roots which like free air moment and the stems growing in a bushy tuft from the base. The stalk is stiff, leaves on the apical portion of the stalk. Flowers are generally apical or if lateral, close to the stalk. Stalk/stem is purple-warted, particularly basally. The rostellum is a distinguishing feature and described as having a broad wavy margin and being perpendicular to the axis of the column. flowers fragrant, some smell like cumin. These can be somewhat temperamental for me, in that they will do well for years then die. They do not like to be disturbed at the roots. Keikis (babies) form on some species.",

Swartz in 1800 in Kungliga Svenska Vetenskapakademiens Avhandlingar. The name is derived from the Greek word onkos (for mass or pad). The genus is not only one of the largest and most popular cultivated orchid genera, it is also a conglomeration of considerably distinct species that have given taxonomists serious problems. During the last 25 years many species have been shifted to new genera or transferred to other, existing genera, notably Cyrtochilum, Psychopsis, Tolumnia and Trichocentrum.\n\r\nOncidiums occur in just about any imaginable habitat. They are, with few exceptions, epiphytic plants. Oncidiums usually produce long, branched, many-flowered, erect to arching inflorescences bearing small to fairly large flowers often in colors from yellow to brown, rarely concolor but usually marked or blotched dark brown. Some of the most popular ones are Onc. leucochilum, Onc. tigrinum, Onc. sarcodes and Onc. varicosum.",

Type species : Ophrys insectifera L.\n\r\nThe genus stands out among european orchids by it's attraction of pollinators by sexual deceit : the odour, optical properties and labellum pilosity contribute to mimic sexually active females of native bees species. The males attempt to copulate with the flowers, incidentally collecting pollinia on their head (section Euoprhys, Photo 1) or abdomen (section Pseudophrys, Photo 2).\n\nWarning: the plants should never be collected in the wild, but only purchased from authorized dealers who can certify culture from seeds.",
