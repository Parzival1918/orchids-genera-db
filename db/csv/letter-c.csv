Cadetia,Gaudich 1829,"ka-DET-ee-ah (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Epidendreae
Subtribe: Dendrobiinae

Derivation: To honor Cadet de Gassicourt; French chemist.
The species in this genus are dwarf epiphytes or rarely lithophytes, rare in today's collections. They are allied to Dendrobium and some taxonomists, including Schlechter, considered them as a section of Dendrobium. Their vegetative appearance and characteristics readily distinguish them from dendrobiums and they are somewhat similar to Pleurothallis in many cases. Cadetia are small flowered and are grown simialarly to the tropical species of Bulbophyllum. They are predominately rainforest plants of low to moderate altitudes and grow on trees or rocks. The genus is divided into three sections: Sarco-Cadetia with a creeping rhizome, undivided lip, and smooth seed capsule; Ptero-Cadetia without a creeping rhizome, 3-lobed lip, and smooth seed capsule and Eu-Cadetia which has a seed capsule densely covered in soft hairs. The stem has a single, fleshy leaf and an inflorescence with one or two flowers, mostly white or pale pink at the apex of the stem.

Regarding culture, the data in the table below are averages for the more common species listed herein. For growing data for specific species, literature, such as Reference 1, is recommended",The sixty or so species are all now included inthe genus Dendrobium,Centered on New Guinea and extending from Tropical Asia to Australia and the Pacific Islands. 
Caladenia,R. Brown 1810,"kal-a-DEN-ee-ah (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Diurideae
Subtribe: Caladeniinae

Terrestrial plants, rootless or with filamentous roots, and witha globose tuber, solitary leaf and unbranched stem;generally hairy. Inflorescence with one to few, bright to dull-colored, small to large, flowers. Lip usually with a marginal fringe and 2-6 rows of club-shaped calli. Type species:&Caladenia carnea R. Br.

Caladenia is a large genus with many showy and elegant, large-flowered species (flower length up to 30 cm). Caladenias are grown mainly by specialist terrestrial growers. A few species are colony-formers, but most are solitary and propagate only by seed. Being rootless, caladenias depend heavily on their mycorrhiza for water and minerals uptake.

Closely related genera : Cyanicula, Leptoceras. Two main groups of species are cultivated: Fairy Orchids have short perianth segments. The calli on the lip are assumed to mimic anthers and to deceive inexperienced pollen-gathering native bees. Spider Orchids have long to filamentous perianth segments. Pollinator attraction is based on sexual deception of male thynnid wasps.",About 250 species. A full revision of this complex genus is needed.,"Mainly Australia. A few species are known from New Zealand, New Caledonia and Indonesia."
Calanthe,Robert Brown 1821,"ka-LAN-thee (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Arethuseae
Subtribe: Bletiinae

Calanthe is a popular, generally winter-blooming genus aptly named from the Greek words kalos (beautiful) and anthe (flower). Apart from its beautiful flowers, the genus is famous because J. Dominy used it to make the first artificial orchid hybrid (Calanthe Dominyi) in the early 1850’s. The genus is allied to Phaius and Gastrorchis. 

There are 2 subgenera with distinctly different growth and flowering habits; Eucalanthe (the evergreen calanthes) and Preptanthe (the deciduous calanthes). Plants belonging to the subgenus Eucalanthe are tropical to cold growing terrestrials consisting of a basal rosette of leaves and without pseudobulbs. Inflorescences are produced from the center of the leaf rosette. This group includes such species as C. triplicata and C. striata from Taiwan to Korea. Japanese growers are breeding their native species to create highly floriferous and beautiful calanthes which can be grown in USDA zone 6b to zone 11 gardens.
Preptanthe species are characterized by prominent pseudobulbs curiously constricted about two-thirds of the way up the pseudobulb. Species in this group are winter-deciduous and inflorescences are produced from near the base of the leafless pseudobulbs.

Evergreen (Eucalanthe) and deciduous (Preptanthe) calanthes do not interbreed and may be separate genera.

Potting: Preptanthe: Separate the individual pseudobulbs after blooming and before soft new growth in the spring. (Two-year old pseudobulbs will wither and rot.) Roots die off during the winter. Use a moisture retentive terrestrial-type potting mix which can include fir bark, sphagnum moss, or peat moss and other organic matter. They also do well with semi-hydroponic culture using Leca type growth media in plastic containers. Do not water the plants until after new growths begin to produce roots to prevent rotting the new growths. Pseudobulbs are extremely brittle and may snap in two during repotting. Broken-off tops can be made to produce new growths by drying them overnight and then lay them horizontally on top of sphagnum moss or other potting media.

Eucalanthe: Cold to cool growing evergreen calanthes perform their best planted outdoors in garden soil in areas USDA zone 6b to zone 11. They will also do well in pots growing in an organic potting media if allowed to get sufficiently cool during winter months. The tropical species should be grown under intermediate to hot conditions year around.",The World Monocot Checklist contains approximately 200 accepted names (9/2007).,"Tropical and subtropical Asia, Africa and Australia to Mexico southward to Colombia and the Caribbean. "
Catasetum,Kunth 1822,"cat-a-SEE-tum (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Cymdibieae
Subtribe: Catasetinae

Catasetum is the largest genus of the subtribe and grows in a variety of conditions. Many grow in the warm, moist open canopy of trees but there are a number that are happiest in the ""boot"" of palm trees. The boot of the palm trees is the base of old leaves that have been shed. Some species can be found on rocks, terrestrially and even in sand. Most of the Catasetum species are like Cycnoches in growth pattern. The new growths rapidly develop in a five to six month period, bloom, loose their leaves and are dormant for periods from one to five months depending on the species and the climatic conditions of their habitat. Another feature that Catasetum species share with Cycnoches is that they bear separate male and female flowers with occasional intermediate or hermaphroditic forms. The female flowers of all the many species of Catasetum are very similar in shape. It is almost impossible to determine the species from female flowers. The female flowers are non-resupinate with a galeate or hood-shaped lip that is uppermost. The column inside the lower portion of the lip is short and broad with the stigma located inside the tip of the column. The male flowers of Catasetum are highly variable among the many species. There are at least 12 to 15 different basic shapes ranging from non-resupinate male flowers such as Ctsm. macrocarpum to the resupinate Ctsm cristatum/barbatum group with lips that bear varying numbers and shapes of projections. The inflorescences originate from the base of the pseudobulbs ranging from arched to smoothly pendent. The pseudobulbs are generally fusiform with a variable number of nodes, from which new growths can originate. The early confusion among the varying sexual and floral forms led to the description of several different genera that were united into Catasetum around the middle of the 19th century.

Cattleya,Lindl 1824,"CAT-lee-ah (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Epidendreae
Subtribe: Laeliinae

Cattleya is a tropical genus of epiphytic and lithophytic plants that produce fairly to exceptionally showy flowers, and by many their species and hybrids are considered THE orchid. There are basically two groups of Cattleyas, the so-called unifoliate and bifoliate. The unifoliate group includes Cattleya labiata, the type species of the genus. Other species in this group include C. mossiae, C. mendellii, C. warscewiczii, C. dowiana, and C. percivaliana. The species in this group produce small to large-sized (up to 8') flowers in colors ranging from yellow to lavender (excluding the color forms, that add a lot of variation); the plants grow fusiform pseudobulbs topped with one fleshy, flattened, elliptic leaf. The bifoliate group, including such species as C. bicolor, C. amethystoglossa, C. elongata, and C. harrisoniana, produces smaller flowers (up to 5' or more, depending on the species), but in larger numbers (up to 40+ on a spike, also depending on species), in colors ranging from green to yellow to brown and pink to lavender; the plants grow tall, cylindric, pencil-like, ringed pseudobulbs that can be up to 5'+ tall in a couple of species - but in most get only to 1' to 2'). The genus was named by John Lindley in honor of William Cattley, a foremost British plant grower of the first half of the 19th Century",The WCSP recognizes around 120 species which includes former Laelia (Brazil) and Sophronitis species. There are numerous natual varieties and natural hybrids in the genus. ,Distribution:
Cattleyopsis,Lindl. 1854,"Cat-lee-opsis (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Epidendreae
Subtribe: Laeliinae

Although the name Cattleyopsis means that the type species, Cattleyopsis lindenii, resembles Cattleya, taxonomically, this genus more closely resembles Laelia because of its eight pollinia. Cattleyopsis is closely related to Broughtonia and Laeliopsis and the World Monocot Checklist currently considers Cattleyopsis to be synonymous with Broughtonia. Although not very common in hobby collections, except in Florida and the Caribbean, the flowers of Cattleyopsis are charming and the plant has a compact growth habit. Quite a few intergeneric hybrids have been made. The most commonly known species is Ctps. lindenii.",The WCSP has moved the 3 species of this genus to Broughtonia.,"The Caribbean islands – Cuba, Bahamas"
Caularthron,"Raf., Fl. Tellur. 2:40 1837","kawl-AR-thron (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Epidendreae
Subtribe: Laeliinae

Known for many years as Diacrium, it was discovered that Rafinesque had previously given the genus the name Caularthron. Consistent with the rules that govern botanical nomenclature, the oldest validly published name has priority. The genus name is derived from the Greek kaulos, stem and arthron, joint in reference to the leaf bases on the pseudobulbs. The genus is characterized by elongated, cylindrical pseudobulbs of several internodes that, like Schomburgkia, are often filled with ants. Used to make many intergeneric hybrids, Caularthron has a presence in many collections, either as a species or as a lovely pot plant as evidenced by crosses such as Caulaelia (formerly Dialaelia) Snowflake. Plants of Caularthron are usually medium sized and compact, allowing for specimen culture. Most commonly found in collections are Cau. bicornutum and Cau. bilamellatum.","The World Monocot Checklist currently recognizes 4 species: Cau. amazonicum, Cau. bicornutum, Cau. bilamellatum, Cau. kraenzlinianum.","Northern South America, Trinidad, Tobago and along the Gulf Coast of Mesoamerica "

Reichenbach filius named this genus to honor Chaubard, a French botanist active during the nineteenth century. The fan shaped plants of Chaubardia are clumping epiphytes with flowers that emerge from between the leaf sheathes. The plants lack pseudobulbs. The sepals and petals are generally similar and spreading, the lateral sepals are basally adnate to a column foot forming a short mentum and the petals are inserted obliquely into the column. The flowers of Chaubardia have a two part lip; the hypochile with a thick toothed or fimbriate callus and the epichile with a mostly flat surface.

Chiloschista,Lindley 1832,"kye-loh-SHIS-tuh (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Vandeae
Subtribe: Sarcanthinae

Upon seeing Chiloschista in flower for the first time, the observer immediately marvels at how this leafless plant can produce such a multitude of flowers. In many texts, this genus is listed as a leafless epiphyte. In reality, however, some species produce leaves, although the leaves are caducous (shed at an early stage of development). This small genus was first named by John Lindley in 1832. The generic name, derived from the Greek words cheilos (lip) and schistos (cleft), describes the cleft lip found on the flowers. The genus is closely allied to Sarcochilus but separated by periodic leaflessness and differences in the lip.

For a portion of the year, these monopodial epiphytes consist of a massive root system emanating from a small, compact stem and nothing else. When leaves are present, they arise from the stem and grow to 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) long and around 0.5 inch (1 cm) wide. By flowering time, the leaves are usually gone. The inflorescences are usually pendent and bear a few to many flowers. The small flowers are most attractive and flower color varies from creamy white to greenish to deep brown-red. Species from this genus include Chiloschista lunifera and C. usneoides.", ,The World Monocot Checklist currently recognizes 19 species. (2007)

Tribe: Maxillarieae
Subtribe: Zygopetalinae

Confusion in this genus has lead to the same species being sold as both Chondrorhyncha and Cochleanthes. Actually, these two genera are easily separated by their floral characteristics. Chondrorhyncha has an elongate column foot and basal callus on the lip while Cochleanthes has a short claw at the base of the column and a lunate (crescent moon-shaped) or radiate callus on the lip. Chondrorhyncha was first described by Lindley in 1846. He coined the generic name from two Greek words chronios [xbonseao] (cartilage) and rhynchus (beak or snout) to describe the beaklike rostellum found in these flowers.

Vegetatively, these sympodial epiphytes are similar to their close relatives (such as Kefersteinia and Huntleya). The plants comprise from one to several closely arranged, loosely irregular fanlike growths connected by a short horizontal rhizome. Each cluster consists of usually four to five leaves up to 12 inches (30 cm) long. The soft leaves, which sometimes have undulate margins, clasp at their bases. The single flower arises from the axil of the leaf on a slender peduncle with up to four light green sheaths. Flowers are 1 to1-1/2 inches (2.5-3.7 cm) across, usually whitish to ivory to lemon yellow with the lips often darker and adorned with varying degrees of reddish to almost chocolate markings or spots. Species cultivated include Chdrh. bicolor (now Chondroscaphe bicolor), Chdrh. flaveola (now Chondroscaphe fimbriata), Chdrh. lendyana, Chdrh. rosea and Chdrh. reichenbachiana (now Benzingia reichenbachiana).", ,"The World Monocot Checklist currently recognizes 27.

It is interesting how some orchids have to travel the globe to find their identity. It is even more unusual when it happens during our generation. This monotypic genus is represented only by Christensonia vietnamica. The plants were discovered by the Czech botanist Jiri Haager during a geological expedition in southern Vietnam. The genus was created in 1993 and named after Eric Christenson in recognition for his work with Vandaceous orchids of the subtribe Aeridinae. While this species shares characteristics with both Aerides and Rhynchostylis, with the publication of Genera Orchidacearum volume 6, it is now included in the genus Vanda.

Cirrhaea,Lindley 1825,"sir-RYE-uh (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Maxillarieae
Subtribe: Stanhopeinae

Cirrhaea is an interesting genus and a joy to behold when the plants are coming into flower. As the inflorescence elongates and the buds develop and mature, the peduncles twist just below the ovary to assure all the flowers face outward. These unique twisted peduncles add an additional interest to the inflorescence in this genus. At maturity all the flowers open on the same day and all drop off simultaneously. Fortunately the flowers do remain open for a week to ten days. Cirrhaea has another plus in that its flowers are very attractive. Cirrhaea is a small genus first described by Lindley in 1825. He derived the generic name from the Latin word cirrus (tendril), undoubtedly to describe the slender, prolonged, almost tendril-like rostellum. Cirrhaea is closely related to Gongora and Polycycnis but differs in lip and column features.

Vegetatively, these sympodial epiphytic plants are similar. They form tight clusters of pseudobulbs, which are either ovoid and ribbed or almost quadrangular. Each pseudobulb is topped by a single, usually erect, petioled, soft, pleated leaf, with the individual leaf blades up to 20 inches (50 cm) long. Several small leafy bracts subtend the developing pseudobulbs, becoming papery and splitting as the bulbs mature. The pendent inflorescence arises from the base of the pseudobulb and bears from a few to many flowers up to 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter. The base colors of the flowers are green to red-brown with some having purple markings. The flowers have a delicate look but are of good substance. Species in cultivation include Cirrhaea dependens and C. fuscolutea (synonym C. saccata).", ,The World Monocot Checklist currently recognizes 7 species (7/2009)

Clowesia,Lindley 1848,"kloh-WES-e-ah (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Cymbidieae
Subtribe: Catasetinae

The genus Clowesia was published by John Lindley based on Clowesia rosea in 1848. Reichenbach transferred the species to Catasetum in 1872 and so it remained until 1975. At that time C. H. Dodson published his revision in which he removed from Catasetum, eight species that bore bisexual or perfect flowers. He resurrected the genus Clowesia with C. rosea as its type from the original description and transferred 4 other species from Catasetum to Clowesia. The remaining three species from Catasetum with perfect or bisexual flowers were placed in the newly established genus Dressleria. Clowesia are found at altitudes ranging from 200 to 1500 meters. It is an epiphytic genus of sympodial orchids that are found in warm, moist open canopy tropical trees, except Clowesia glaucoglossa found in one particular species of palm in one small area of southwest Mexico. Pseudobulbs are somewhat fusiform to conical in shape with thin veined leaves during the growth season. Like Catasetum and Cycnoches, the bulbs grow to maturity in 6 to 7 months and lose their leaves in a rest period. Some of the species bloom on new maturing growths, while others such as Clowesia rosea bloom from completely leafless pseudobulbs. The inflorescences emerge from the base of the pseudobulbs and are sharply pendent unlike the more arching, pendant inflorescences of Catasetum. There are two particularly beautiful and fragrant hybrids, Clowesia (Catasetum) Grace Dunn and Clowesia (Catasetum) Rebecca Northen. Because the International Orchid Registration Authority and the RHS do not recognize the genus Clowesia as valid, all Clowesia species and hybrids are still listed as Catasetum. The American Orchid Society judging system accepts Clowesia as a valid genus for species, so awards are now listed as Clowesia although the older awards are still listed under Catasetum. Because of the rules of registration, the A.O.S still lists the many Clowesia hybrids under Catasetum or the intergeneric hybrids using Catasetum. For example a hybrid of Clowesia and Cycnoches would be registered as Catanoches.",The World Monocot Checklist contains 8 accepted names (9/2007).,"Mexico, 5 species; one species, Clowesia warscewiczii, from Central America to Ecuador and Venezuela, one species Clowesia amazonica from the Brazilian Amazon and Ecuador "

The genus was established in 1853 by John Lindley (1799 – 1865). Its name is derived from the Greek word “kochlioides” for “spiral”. The type species is Cda. densiflora Lindl. The genus consists of about six epiphytic plants inhabiting montane cloud forests in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru at altitudes between 1700 m and 3300 m. The small plants impress with their medium length, rarely branched inflorescences bearing numerous flowers whose brilliant colors range from yellow and orange to lilac, red and purple. The flower shape varies from full and round to rather open with narrow segments.

This popular genus has pseudobulbs with one or two pleated leaves. These pseudobulbs vary in size and are mostly of an ovoid shape and can be closely or widely spaced on the rhizome. The leaves may also be closely spaced or far apart. The genus was described by Lindley in 1825. In reference to the hollow stigmatic area on the column, he named the genus from two Greek words: koilos (hollow) and gyne (female). The species of Coelogyne are popular in collections due to their mostly fragrant, free flowering, showy inflorescences. Those most often found include C. cristata, C. speciosa, C. fimbriata, C. massangeana and C. dayana.

Barbara Gravendeel of the University of Leiden, Netherlands published a reorganization of Coelogyne in 2000. She reports “Most species are epiphytes, occurring in tropical lowland and montane rainforests. In open, humid environments, some species may also grow as lithophytes or even as terrestrial plants. Most species are characterized by medium sized to large flowers with a sweet scent and are pollinated by bees, beetles or wasps.

In nature, these orchids are encountered in so-called ant gardens. The symbiotic occurences provides benefits for both; ants get nectar from extrafloral nectaries and can use the root ball for construction of their nests, the Coryanthes plant is protected and fertilized by the ants. The pollination biology is also very fascinating: trying to collect fragrance compounds below the upper part (hypochile) of the lip, the male euglossine bee falls in the liquid filled bucket of the apical part (epichile). It cannot escape flying because its wings are wet. The only way is to climb up an island (callus of lip) and to pass a tunnel formed by the tip of the lip and the column. Doing this the flower gets pollinated or glues the pollinarium on the bee. The whole passage is very hard for the bee and lasts about half an hour. The genus could be divided into to sections: Coryanthes with a smooth mesochile (middle part of the lip) and Lamellunguis with warts or lamellae on it. Most species have pendulous inflorescences, some of them have upright ones. Coryanthes has the heaviest flowers in orchidaceae, the biggest one C. bruchmuelleri have a weight of more than 100g.", ,The World Monocot Checklist contains 49 accepted names (9/2007).

This was the name when originally described by P. La Llave and J. Lexarza in 1824. James Bateman transferred it to Odontoglossum in 1874 where it was known as Odontoglossum citrosmum Lind., and, because of the pendulous inflorescence, later became known as Odontoglossum pendulum. In 1975, Halbinger transferred it back to Cuitlauzina as a monotypic species.

When I first acquired this plant in 1985 it was called Odontoglossum citrosmum, and I tried to grow it like my other odontoglossums. It grew very well but never flowered. I then read about its habitat, and changed its culture, following which there was a dramatic change in flower production. Watering is the critical aspect of culture if flowers are to be produced. Starting with flowering, usually in June, this plant is watered often enough to keep it constantly moist, and this may be every day in hot weather. Watering is continued until new growth, which usually starts in December or the first of January, commences. The tendency is to continue watering with the onset of new growth, but if one does there will be no initiation of an inflorescence. Stop all watering with the beginning of new growth or by the first of the new year. Inflorescences usually start in April-May from the emerging new growths, and if one waters then, the flower buds will not develop; after the buds develop, if one waters, the buds will usually abort. Resume watering after the flowers start to open-usually in June. The inflorescences grow straight up for three to four inches and then make an abrupt turn downward and grow straight down for 12 to 18 inches with the flowers arranged around the distal third of the inflorescence. With this amount of drying the mature pseudobulbs become rather crenated even in an environment of high humidity; however, after resuming watering the pseudobulbs plump up after 3-4 months. The new growth will mature between the end of flowering and the end of the year, when new growth will again appear.

Cyclopogon,Presl 1827,"si-klo-PO-gahn (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Cranichideae
Subtribe: Spiranthinae

Cyclopogon was first described in 1827 by K.B. Presl. He coined the generic name from the Greek kyklos (circle) and pogon (beard) an allusion to the fine sepals that resemble a circle of beards. Subsequently, many botanists included Cyclopogon in Spiranthes until 1920 when Schlechter revised the Spiranthinae and determined Cyclopogon a separate genus.

Cycnoches,Lindley 1832,"sik-NO-keys (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Cymbidieae
Subtribe: Catasetinae

Cycnoches is an epiphytic genus of sympodial orchids that are usually found in warm, moist, open canopy tropical trees. The altitude can range up to 1500 meters depending on the latitude of the location. Pseudobulbs are spindle-shaped with multiple nodes and three to seven pairs of thin, veined leaves. The pendulous inflorescences arise from the upper nodes of the pseudobulb. Cycnoches, like orchids of its sister genus Catasetum, are unique among orchids in that they bear separate male and female flowers with the occasional appearance of intermediate, hermaphroditic forms. The column structure is the surest method of determining the sex of flowers. The male column is long, curved, and thin. It bears the pollinia prominently at the tip. The female column is relatively short and bearing curved hook-like structures on each side of the tip. The stigma of the female column is found inside the tip of the column. here are two different forms of male flowers among the cycnoches. One group, the section Cycnoches, bears male and female flowers that closely resemble each other except for the column structure. The section Heteranthae bears male flowers that are radically different from the female flowers. The female flowers of section Heteranthae resemble the female flowers of section Cycnoches except that they are normally smaller. The male flowers of section Heteranthae are small with a disk-shaped lip that has from 5 to 14 projections or ""fingers"" on it.  Cycnoches are very fragrant with a generally complex chemical structure that distinguishes the species to their pollinators among the Euglossine bees. Like the other members of the Catasetinae, cycnoches can produce new growths from almost any of the nodes of the pseudobulb. Cycnoches are seasonal growers. The new growths are produced and rapidly develop to maturity in about six months when they produce their flowers. After flowering, the leaves are frequently dropped and a dry rest period follows before new growth starts again. The genus name comes from two Greek words that mean swan and neck. The type species is C. loddigesii described in 1832 by John Lindley. In addition to this species, other popular species are Cycnoches chlorochilon, C. haagii, C. pentadactylon, C. barthiorum.

Cymbidiella,Rolfe 1918,"sim-bid-ee-EL-ah (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Cymbidieae
Subtribe: Cyrtopodiinae

The name Cymbidiella is a diminutive of Cymbidium due to its superficial resemblance. Cymbidiella is allied to Cymbidium and was long known in horticulture as Cymbidium although it is closer in its affinity to Eulophiella, This genus is characterized by large, terrestrial or epiphytic plants that are robust in nature. Their fan-shaped leaves and pale green flowers with purplish-black markings and three lobed lip form a striking combination. The pseudobulbs are elongated and present on short to long rhizomes. The flowers of Cymbidiella are long lasting and very spectacular. Most commonly grown is Cymbidiella pardalina (syn. rhodochila).", ,The World Monocot Checklist currently recognizes 3 species (July 2009).
Cymbidium,Sw. 1799,"sim-BID-ee-um (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Cymbidieae
Subtribe: Cyrtopodiinae

The genus has about a hundred recognized species (The World Monocot Checklist recognizes 64 species and numerous natural hybrids) of which fewer than twenty have been used in horticulture. It is very unlikely that any discoveries of showy new species will occur in the future. Close affinity is recognized with Grammatophyllum and successful intergeneric hybrids have been made. The name derives from the Greek ktmbes, boat shaped, an allusion to the shape of the lip.

Modern Cymbidium hybrids trace back to less than ten species, mostly growing in the higher elevations of the mountainous backbone of Asia and supplemented more recently by the influence of the miniaturizing species C. pumilum (syn. C floribundum) and the heat-tolerant species C. ensifolium. Some hobbyists enjoy cultivating the species of China and Japan and these will be discussed separately.

Cymbidiums are not particularly prone to many pests. Red spider is always a concern and is a sign that the plants are in too hot an environment, with too little humidity. Often, just changing your growing conditions will eliminate the problem and if not, a good spraying with any paraffinic oil like Ultra-Fine on a regular basis (once every three weeks) will keep plants squeaky clean. Be careful that aphids don’t attack your buds as they emerge from the flower sheath. The two common orchid viruses are a problem in Cymbidiums so make sure you practice hygienic growing and also be wary of introducing plants from suspect sources. One of the advantages with Cymbidiums is that the common viruses produce visible leaf symptoms so the infected plants can be isolated, checked and eliminated easily.

Oriental species are renowned for their fragrance and subtle charm Often they are grown in decorative deep pots as their root systems tend to grow down rather than branch. Most are terrestrial in their native habitat as well as semi-dormant over winter so they can take dry and cool temperatures at this time. Media can be quite complicated but we find they will also grow easily in traditional Cymbidium mixes to which a bit more perlite or some small pebbles are added.

Cynorkis,Thouars 1809,"sin-OR-kiss (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Orchidacea
Subtribe: Orchidacea

Cynorkis contains about 125 species of tuberous-rooted, mostly terrestrial plants. The genus was first described in 1822 by Aubert Du Petit-Thouars who coined the name from two Greek words, kynosa (dog) and orchis (testicle), to describe the small testiculate tubers of this genus. Cynorkis is a very attractive genus seldom seen in cultivation. The flowers are as pretty and showier than those of many cultivated orchids. Because Cynorkis species are deciduous and dormant for more than half the year, growers are discouraged from growing these species; the dormant plant is completely out of sight, making its container appear to be an empty pot of soil. These delightful plants are well worth growing and enjoying, however, as they go through a complete cycle – from emergence of the first leaf to the dispersal of seeds – in about five months.

The basic colors of Cynorkis flowers are mauve and pink. Some of the species include: C. kassnerana, C. lowiana, C. purpurascens, C. purpurea and C. uniflora.", ,"About 125. The World Monocot Checklist recognizes 159 species plus additional subspecies,varieties and 2 natural hybrids."
Cyrtopodium,R. Br. 1813,"ser-toe-POH-dee-um (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Cymbidieae
Subtribe: Cyrtopodiinae

Cyrtopodiums are popularly known as the cow-horn orchid because of their cigar-shaped, fleshy pseudobulbs. The name of this genus is derived from the Greek kyrtos, curved swelling and podion, little foot in reference to the shape of the column which curves upward. In flower, Cyrtopodiums can be spectacular with panicles of many yellow to yellow-green flowers, often with maroonish spots and large bracts. The plants are mostly medium to large in size and are terrestrial, lithophytic or epiphytic. Although the flowers can appear dull in color, this is compensated by the large, branched inflorescences and colorful bracts. Most commonly seen in collections are C. andersonii, the type species, and C. punctatum, a Florida native.", ,The World Monocot Checklist currently recognizes 46 species. (7/2009)
