Renanthera,Lour. 1790,"Ren-AN-the-ra (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Vandeae 
Subtribe: Aeridinae


The genus Renanthera was described in 1790 by the missionary/botanist Joao Loureiro, based on Ren. coccinea as the type species. The name Renanthera is a combination of the Latin ""renis"" meaning kidney, and the Greek ""anthera"" or anther, and refers to the distinct kidney shape of the pollinia, characteristic of this genus.
Renanthera is a monopodial genus from Southeast Asia, where weather and temperatures are optimal for a growth habit which has no pseudobulbs for water storage. The plants of some species are long and vining, others may be only 6-8 inches tall at maturity, and with a very short length of stem between alternating leaves. Most species are epiphytic, but several may be lithophytic. Some of the more vining species begin their lives as terrestrial seedlings germinated among the mycorrhizal fungi in dead logs and humus. Several species of Renanthera are narrow endemics, found only in a small area with very specialized habitat; Ren. imschootiana is considered rare and endangered and is listed on CITES Appendix 1 for which no international trade is allowed except for nursery-flasked and/or raised plants.
Renanthera flowers are usually red, red-orange, or yellow, some with red or purple spots or blotches. Texture may be matte or velvety. Some species provide a spectacular display of 100+ flowers on a large branching inflorescence.
Ren. storiei, the species with the largest red velvety flowers, and unfortunately the largest plant habit, has been the most popular hybrid parent. More recent hybrids emphasize smaller plant size, and utilize Ren. philippinensis, Ren. imschootiana, and Ren. bella (all fine red-flowered species) as parents.",The WCSP currently recognizes 23 species and 2 varieties.

Restrepia,"Humboldt, Bonpland & Kunth 1816","re-STREP-ee-ah (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Epidendreae 
Subtribe: Pleurothallidinae


Restrepia, first described in 1815, is another genus that in the past was included in Pleurothallis. The species are small in size, with a tufted growth habit. Despite their size, many of the species are quite showy with many single flowered inflorescences on a well-grown plant. The genus was named to honor José E. Restrepo, one of the early explorers of the Antioquian Andes in Colombia. Pridgeon calls Restrepia “a well-defined genus of about 25 ill-defined species found in Central America and the Andes”. The type species is R. antennifera. Other species found in specialist collections include R. dodsonii, R. muscifera (Pridgeon believes that many of the plants so labeled are indistinguishable look-alikes) and R. teaguei.

Restrepiella,Garay and Dunsterville 1966,"reh-strep-ee-ELL-uh (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Epidendreae 
Subtribe: Pleurothallidinae


There are many closely allied genera in the Pleurothallidinae and many are hard to identify by the average hobbyist. However, this monotypic genus is probably more easily separated from some of its close relatives (such as Restrepia) by the presence of four pollinia instead of two and the easily recognized fetid odor of the flower. The genus was first described by Garay and Dunsterville in 1966 as they felt there were sufficient differences to warrant the change. They named the genus Restrepiella to indicate the close resemblance to Restrepia. Today, only the type species remains in the genus: all others have been transferred to either Restrepiopsis, Dressleriella or Pleurothallis.

Vegetatively, Restrepiella plants form tight clumps of erect secondary stems (ramicauls) connected by a short horizontal rhizome. Each secondary stem on this sympodial epiphyte is up to 8 inches (20 cm) tall and may have up to three nodes, each with a pronounced papery bract up to 3 inches (8 cm) in length. Each stem is topped by a single, erect, petioled, oblong leaf up to 7 inches (18 cm) long and 1-1/2 inches (4 cm) wide.

The flowers are borne in the axils of the leaves. Usually one flower, but occasionally two will open at the same time. Basically the flowers are creamy yellow with great variation in the number and size of the reddish spots. The small flowers (1-1/2 inches [4 cm]) are almost fleshy and have been likened to a serpent’s wide-open mouth. The sepals are the largest floral segments with the lateral sepals fused almost to their tips similar to the synsepal in Paphiopedilum.

“To be or not to be Rhyncholaelia, that is the question.” For more than 70 years, the question has been: What is the correct generic name for this plant and for other species like it? Is it Rhyncholaelia, Laelia or Brassavola? In 1918, Rudolph Schlechter recognized that two species of spectacular flowering plants were sufficiently different taxonomically from Cattleya, Laelia and Brassavola to be placed in a separate genus. He coined the generic name Rhyncholaelia from the Greek word rhynchos (snout) and the genus name Laelia, undoubtedly a reference to the seed capsule, which Schlechter considered a main point in his generic separation. Although still debated by taxonomists, Rhyncholaelia is considered by most as the proper generic name. From a horticulturist’s standpoint, however, Brassavola probably will continue to be used as the generic name to be consistent with the thousands of hybrids already recorded, that is until those names are changed.

Vegetatively, these sympodial epiphytes are very easy to distinguish from their close relatives. They have club-shaped to spindle-shaped pseudobulbs that often are hidden by very glaucous, almost white sheaths. Each pseudobulb is topped by a single stiff, leathery, gray-green, glaucous leaf that is usually elliptic and up to 8 inches (20 cm) long. Each growth bears a single flower subtended by a very large, leafy sheath.

The basic flower colors are light green to creamy white, with an occasional flower displaying a pale lavender-pink tint. The throats of the flowers range from emerald green in color to having a large rose-colored spot. The flowers which can be up to 7 inches (17.5 cm) in diameter are very similar as far as their sepals and petals are concerned, usually being alike in size, shape and color, with the segments of Rhyncholaelia glauca a little more reflexed. The lips, however, are so distinctly different that these two species can be separated easily without question. Rhyncholaelia digbyana has an extremely large, slightly three-lobed lip, which has a very deeply fringed margin, whereas R. glauca has a broad, blunt, fringeless lip",The WCSP contains 2 accepted names (2/2020).,"Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Belize"
Rhynchostylis,Blume 1825,"rink-oh-STY-lis (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Vandeae 
Subtribe: Vandeae


Carl Blume described this small genus in the 1820’s. This epiphytic, monopodial genus is characterized by its very thick, leathery, closely arranged leaves with short stems and, vegetatively closely resembles Aerides except for the shorter stems and thicker leaves. Due to the erect or pendent inflorescences of closely packed flowers, Rhynchostylis is commonly known as the foxtail orchid (as is Aerides). The generic name was derived from the Greek rhyncho, beak and stylis, column, in reference to the beaked column exhibited in this genus.

The flowers of Rhynchostylis are very fragrant, small and typically white with light to deep magenta, red or lavender-blue spots. Their small size is more than compensated for by the large number of flowers produced on multiple inflorescences. As a result of line breeding, many plants of Rhynchostylis gigantea exhibit boldly patterned flowers or seemingly solid colored dark red-lavender flowers (Sagarit strain). White and even peach-apricot colored forms have recently been introduced. Improvements have also been made to another commonly grown species in this genus, namely R. coelestis. In today’s marketplace the hobbyist can find examples of this species of a deep lavender-blue color. ",The WCSP currently recognizes 5 species. Two subspecies of Rhynchostylis gigantea; R. gigantea subsp. gigantea and R. gigantea subsp. violacea are also recognized. (7/2009),"India, Malaya, Indonesia and the Philippines"

Gaudichaud established this genus, of monopodial orchids, in 1826. The generic epithet honours a French chemist, Pierre Robiquet. Type species for this genus is Robiquetia ascendens. Usually the plants are quite large in this genus and the flowers, though small, are produced in good numbers on pendulous inflorescences. Commonly seen species are Robiquetia cerina and Robiquetia compressa. These are normally plants in a specialist collection.<",The World Checklist of Monocotyledons recognizes 103 species.

Etymology: After Ross, a collector for Barker, Greek glossa, tongue. The type species is described by John Lindley as Odontoglossum insleayi in 1840 and transferred to Rossioglossum by Kennedy and Garay in 1976. In some collections, Rossioglossum grande will be tagged  by its older name, Odontoglossum grande.
