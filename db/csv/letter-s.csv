Sarcochilus,R. Brown 1810,"sar-koh-KYE-luss (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Vandeae 
Subtribe: Aeridinae


Although widespread through much of Southeast Asia and south to Australia, Sarcochilus has not had the attention it richly deserves. The attractive, flowering plants of this genus make handsome specimens. When Robert Brown first described the genus in 1810, he combined 2 Greek words, sarcos (flesh) and cheilos (lip), to describe the fleshy lips. While there have been more than 150 names published in this genus, the World Monocot Checklist currently recognizes only 25 of them as distinct species, many of them formerly scattered among several genera.

Sarcochilus species are mostly epiphytic, although some grow on rocks and others might be classified as semiterrestrial. The growth of true Sarchochilus species resembles that of a miniature Vanda species although clumps are often formed. Each growth has 5 or more leathery leaves, with clasping leaf bases, up to 12 inches (30 cm) long and 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide. The inflorescences arise from the axils of the leaves and bear 5 or more flowers. The flowers, which can be up to 2 inches (5 cm) in diameter, range in color from white to yellow, often with red speckling. The three-lobed lip varies among the species and may be very showy (e.g. S. fitzgeraldii) or very small.

Scaphosepalum,Pfitzer 1888,"ska-fo-SE-pah-lum (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Pleurothallidinae 
Subtribe: Epidendreae


Scaphosepalum was established as a genus in 1888 by Pfitzer. Various species had been known to science since 1849 when Reichenbach had first published Masdevallia verrucosa, which later became Pleurothallis verrucosa and finally, under Pfitzer's treatment, Scaphosepalum verrucossum. The etymology is from the Greek 'scaphosepalos' or 'with boatlike sepals', referring to the shape of the lateral sepals. This is the hallmark of the genus, these cushion-like portions of the lateral sepals that are uppermost in the non-resupinate flowers. Vegetatively the species of Scaphosepalum are very similar to those of Dracula or Masdevallia: short ramicauls that bear a more or less elliptical leaf at the apex. The inflorescence is a successively flowered raceme borne by an erect or descending peduncle, usually produced near the base of the leaf. The plants range in size from the miniature (i.e. Scaph. rapax, 1.5 - 3.5 cm tall) to the large and robust (i.e. Scaph. antenniferum, to 30 cm tall). Besides the species mentioned above, other commonly grown species include Scaphosepalum breve, Scaph. grande, Scaph. lima, Scaph, swertifolium.

Scuticaria,Lindley 1843,"skoot-ih-CARE-ee-uh (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Maxillarieae 
Subtribe: Zygopetalinae


Scuticaria is a very small, captivating genus consisting of about 9 unique species. At first glance, the flowers are reminiscent of those of Maxillaria, to which they are closely allied. In 1843, John Lindley removed S. steelii from Maxillaria and founded the new genus. Lindley chose the generic name based on the Greek word scutica (lash), undoubtedly referring to the long, whip-like terete leaves so typical of this genus. Unfortunately, Scuticaria is not as widely grown as a fine, attractive genus should be.

This group of sympodial epiphytes has distinctive, grooved, terete, pendent leaves that may be up to 4 feet (120 cm) long, with most averaging 2 to 3 feet (60-90 cm) and not more than a pencil thick. The leaves are borne in fairly tight clusters. Each flowering scape may have 2 to 3 flowers.

Flower colors are basically combinations of browns and yellow-greens. The fleshy flowers are up to 3 inches (7.5 cm) in diameter (e.g. Scuticaria steelii). Species most commonly found in collections are S. steelii and S. hadwenii",The WCSP currently recognizes 13 species. (1/2020),"Brazil, Guyana, Venezuela

This monotypic genus includes the one species, Seidenfadenia mitrata, which was for many years (and still may be) sold in the orchid trade as Aerides mitrata. In 1972 Leslie Garay established this new genus in honor of Gunnar Seidenfaden, noted researcher on the orchids of Thailand. Certain technical differences in the flowers as well as the semiterete foliage distinguish this genus from Aerides. Seidenfadenia mitrata typically flowers in the spring producing inflorescences from the base of the semiterete foliage.",The World Monocot Checklist recognizes one species.,"Burma, Thailand"
Sievekingia,Reichenbach f. 1871,"seeve-KING-ee-uh (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Maxillarieae 
Subtribe: Stanhopeinae


Lovely flowers are borne in dense clusters on pendulous inflorescences in this tropical American genus. Sievekingia is a small genus that can be divided into two sections: those with entire lips (S. herrenhusana) and those with fimbriate-lacerate lips (S. reichenbachiana). Sievekingia was first described by Reichenbach f. in 1871, who named the genus in honor of Dr. Sieveking, then Burgermeister of Hamburg, Germany.

Vegetatively, Sievekingia plants resemble small Stanhopea plants. These sympodial epiphytes (sometimes lithophytes) form clusters of ovoid, ribbed pseudobulbs. The single noded pseudobulbs are subtended by imbricated sheaths, which are not persistent. Each pseudobulb is topped by a single-petioled leaf up to 10-12 inches (25-30 cm) long. The soft leaf blades are heavily ribbed. From the base of the pseudobulbs arise pendent inflorescences. The clusters of flowers open rapidly and are attractive. The base colors of the up to 2 inch (5 cm) diameter flowers are creamy white or yellow with some having purple spotting. 

There is some floral variation among Sievekingia species. The sepals are usually alike in size, shape and color, while there is variation in the petals. The petals may be the same shape and color as the sepals but are usually slightly smaller and have either entire margins (S. herrenhusana) or lacerated margins (S. reichenbachiana) and may be bent forward and partially hood the column. Species in cultivation include S. herrenhusana, S. peruviana, S. reichenbachiana and S. suavis.",The World Monocot Checklist currently recognizes 16 species. (7/2009),Costa Rica south to Bolivia
Sobralia,Ruiz & Pavón 1794,"so-BRAL-ee-ah (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Arethuseae 
Subtribe: Sobraliinae

Often beautiful plants of leafy reed-like stems with heavily veined leaves, the genus Sobralia is characterized by colorful cattleya-like flowers that are short lived, lasting in many cases only a day at most. What the flowers lack in longevity, they make up by flowering over an extended period of time. In size, the species of Sobralia vary from smallish to over 18 feet in height. So too, can flower size vary from an inch or two to 10 inches across. Colors also are variable from pinks to lavenders and magentas to yellows and whites. Although most species grow best under intermediate conditions, others, such as S. decora thrive in hot, humid south Florida . Sobralia was described in 1794 and is allied to Elleanthus. The genus was named in honor of the Spanish physician and botanist Francisco Sobral, a friend of the authors. Many sobralias are in hobbyist collections. Some of the larger growing species make good subjects for garden plants. At some of the orchid festivals held throughout the country  many different species of Sobralia can be purchased. Some of the more commonly found species include S. decora, S. macrantha, S. rosea, S. leucoxantha, S. violacea. If you are looking for a blue orchid, Sobralia warscewiczii fits the bill.  While rare in cultivation, if you find one it's certainly a must-have.  It's flowers are very large, similar to S. macrantha, and distinctly blue

This  historic and increasingly popular group of orchids rewards the grower with magnificent foliage and brilliant flowers. For horticultural purposes, I divide sobralias into two general groups THE EPHEMERAL group, which includes all those whose flowers last a single day or less, and the FIELD group, where the flowers last from two to seven days.",The World Monocot Checklist contains approximately 137 accepted names (9/2007).,"Throughout tropical America; from Mexico through Central America to South America, in both tropical and high elevations."
Sophronitella,(Lindley) Schlecter 1925,"sow-fro-ni-TE-la (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Epidendreae 
Subtribe: Laeliinae


Sophronitella is a monotypic genus endemic to Brazil. The species occurs in mountainous areas with altitude from 2,500 to 4,500 feet (800 to 1,400m more or less), from the coast to about 400 miles (about 650 Km.) inland. Plants are usually found as epiphytes on small trees that are fairly open and, in some case totally deciduous, with bark that is quite rough allowing a bit of organic matter to accumulate and feed the plants. This kind of habitat allows the plants to receive a lot of light, especially during the time of the year when the trees loose their leaves. This condition also allows the plants to be subjected to a constant breeze and sometimes a lot of wind. Plants are sometimes found growing on rocks, under basically the same conditions. The only species in the genus, Sophronitella violacea, was described by John Lindley as Sophronitis violacea, and later changed to Sophronitella by Rudolf Schlechter, indicating a diminutive Sophronitis, originally derived from the Greek word sophron (chaste or modest), probably in reference to the small size of the plants. This is a very uniform species in terms of color, With the exception of a single plant with pure white flowers, all specimens are a uniform bright magenta.",The World Monocot Checklist currently recognizes the one species in this genus as Isabelia violacea.

Sophronitis,Lindley 1828,"sof-roe-NYE-tis (click on the name to hear it spoken)
Tribe: Epidendreae 
Subtribe: Laeliinae

Sophronitis traditionally is a fairly small genus of tropical distribution in Brazil. In it's strictest circumscription, there are two groups of species in the genus. The first includes only one species, Sophronitis cernua, which is also the type species; according to some, there is also S. pterocarpa, although the flowers are essentially the same and only the winged pedicels (at the ovaries section) differ from those of S. cernua.

Sophronitis cernua is a warm growing species, being found from sea level at the coast to about 3,000 ft. in the dry interior of Brazil; it is abundant wherever it is found.

The second group includes Sophronitis coccinea and several other very closely related species. With the exception of Sophronitis brevipenduculata, which grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte on the dryer and more central mountainous area of Brazil, all others are found in the trpical cloud forest near the coast at more than about 2,000 ft. elevation. These plants are abundant, especially Sophronitis coccinea, growing in areas with lots of fog and high humidity during all the year. In it's broadest circumscription, Sophronitis also includes all of the former Brazilian Laelia species making the genus rather diverse. ","Strictly defined between half a dozen and a dozen, according to the particular taxonomist involved. Currently the World Monocot Checklist recognizes approximately 68 species and 9 natural hybrids, now including the Brazilian Laelias in Sophronitis (Laelia purpurata is now Sophronitis purpurata). For horticultural purposes, many hobbyists and commercial growers limit Sophronitis to the half dozen to dozen species referred to in the upper paragraph. Genera Orchidacearum Vol. 5 will transfer the entire genus Sophronitis including the Brazilian laelias to Cattleya and the World Checklist will follow soon thereafter.",Brazil

Carl Blume established this beautiful terrestrial genus in 1825. The generic name is from the Greek spathe = spathe and glotta = tongue and refers to the shape of the labellum. Type species for this genus is Spathoglottis plicata. In tropical climates, Spathoglottis are commonly seen growing as garden plants. There are many beautiful species and hybrids that seem to be constantly in flower. The flowers are generally large and the colour range is extensive. Commonly seen species are Spathoglottis plicata and Spathoglottis vanoverbergh",The World Checklist of Monocotyledons recognizes 49 species and 1 natural hybrid.

Tribe: Maxillarieae 
Subtribe: Stanhopeinae


Stanhopea is a genus of epiphytic, sympodial orchids with pendant inflorescences. It was first described by Sir William Hooker in 1829, through publication of Stanhopea insignis in the Botanical Magazine. The genus is named for the Rt. Hon. Philip Henry Stanhope, Earl of Stanhope, President of the Medico-Botanical Society of London 1829-1837. 

Stanhopeas are found growing from sea level to about 4000m elevation. They have plicate, dark-medium green leaves with distinct, grooved petioles. The pseudobulbs range in size from small walnuts to large pears. The plants are medium-sized and can grow into very large clumps. The necessity of growing in baskets makes them best suited for outdoor cultivation or the greenhouse collection, rather than windowsill or under artificial lights. 

Most species produce a pendant raceme of medium to large spiral flowers, often pleasantly to voluptuously fragrant, and pollinated exclusively in nature by male euglossine bees. The lip structure is very complicated, divided into three parts called the hypochile, mesochile, and epichile. Commonly grown species are Stanhopea candida, Stan. grandiflora, Stan. oculata, Stan. tigrina, and Stan. wardii. As of 2000, there were 46 RHS-registered hybrids, including the magnificent Stan. Assidensis (tigrina x wardii). Intergeneric hybrids include Cirrhopea, Coryhopea, Stangora, and Stanhocycnis.",The World Monocot Checklist contains 66 accepted names (9/2007).
